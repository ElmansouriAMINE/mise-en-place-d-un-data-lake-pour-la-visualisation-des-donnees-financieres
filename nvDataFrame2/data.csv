Why knock yourself out trying to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions when you can continue to produce the emissions and then snatch them back from the atmosphere?

Trump aired. A month later, they still haven’t stopped. | The technical term might be “vertical integration.” Or, on reflection, perhaps that is not quite right, and it would — in the jargon — be known as “synergy.” Maybe those are the same thing. Either way, the concept is best encapsulated by Jack Donaghy, the vulpine executive portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the presumably now problematic sitcom “30 Rock.” | More than a year and a half after Amazon workers on Staten Island voted to form the company’s first union in the United States, the company appears to be taking a harder line toward labor organizing, disciplining workers and even firing one who had been heavily involved in the union campaign. | On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first gene editing therapy ever to be used in humans, for sickle cell disease, a debilitating blood disorder caused by a single mutated gene. | Individual athletes from Russia and Belarus who successfully qualify for next summer’s Paris Olympics will be allowed to compete in the Games, the International Olympic Committee announced on Friday, ending talk of a blanket ban on competitors from the two nations over the war in Ukraine. | British American Tobacco, the parent company of Camel and Lucky Strike, said the rise of vaping was a big reason it was writing down the value of its brands. | In “Anatomy of a Scene,” we ask directors to reveal the secrets that go into making key scenes in their movies.

Maybe at your local chess club, maybe in tournaments. Online, offline! Or — ” he paused for emphasis “ — against bots.” | Beth (Niamh Carolan) spends her days — or is it nights? — patrolling her small Canadian town where sunlight no longer exists and where zombielike humans called strays wander the snow-covered streets. To fight malaise, townspeople are supposed to take happy pills, but Beth has stopped doing so, apparently immune to whatever is causing her neighbors to turn rabid. As she increasingly has nightmares about a pustule-covered version of herself who turns people into strays, Beth starts to wonder if she may be the affliction’s cause — and cure. | More than 1,100 workers at DHL Express’s global air cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport went on strike on Thursday after months of failed negotiations with the parcel carrier. | Manchester is a city of glory and grit. Set among the damp northwest hills of England, it’s the rain-spattered home of Northern soul and legendary bands like Joy Division, New Order and Oasis; two world famous soccer clubs; the cradle of the industrial revolution; and one of the most vibrant nightlife scenes on the planet. Style and swagger? This proud city has them in spades. But most people would not consider it a capital of high fashion. | With great fanfare this week, CNN announced it would host the network’s first debate of the 2024 presidential campaign, gathering the Republican candidates for a marquee event on Jan. 21 at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. | Some solvers love them, some solvers hate them, but rebus elements pop up fairly often in late-week crosswords.

It is essential that Congress overcome this opposition and approve it promptly, as an investment in America’s security goals. | The Noguchi Museum in New York announced Friday that Amy Hau would be its next director. Hau, 59, currently the managing partner of the architecture and urban design firm WXY, is returning to the institution where she began her career, in 1986, as the assistant to the Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi, who synthesized Eastern and Western influences and modernism with a respect for nature. She helped steward the museum, in Long Island City, Queens, for almost three decades after Noguchi’s death in 1988. | The leaders of Harvard, M.I.T. and the University of Pennsylvania face increasing pressure after their disastrous testimony before Congress this week regarding antisemitism on college campuses.

(Liz Magill of Penn and Claudine Gay of Harvard later apologized for their testimony.) | Good morning. Hanukkah got underway last night; Christmas is looming and Kwanzaa’s right on its heels. In less than a month we’ll be in 2024. It’s the season of holiday parties. Be in good cheer. | Emma Stone’s performance as Whitney so far has been a master class in, well, performance. Whitney is a person who is nearly constantly “on.” She’s always trying to say and do what she perceives as correct in both her business and her relationship with Asher. It’s hard to tell if she ever really says what she means. Occasionally, Stone gets a glint behind her eyes that might suggest Whitney’s true feelings, but then she shakes it off, smiles, and goes on performing. | President Biden has welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some more fuel into Gaza, the White House said, but he stressed during a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday that more aid was urgently needed and called for corridors to allow people to flee for safer areas. | When was the last time you danced? | The latest release in Jeff Kinney’s mega-successful “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” franchise of books, movies and merchandise (Tote bags! Board games! Stress balls!) is this animated holiday tale in which a middle schooler, Greg Heffley (voiced by Wesley Kimmel from “The Mandalorian”), gets trapped in his house with his family when a blizzard blows into town. Just before he got snowed in, Greg and his BFF, Rowley (Spencer Howell), accidentally damaged a snowplow after sending a giant snowball rolling down a hill. Greg and Rowley flee the scene, and Greg spends his time cooped up worrying that he’ll be caught by the authorities and won’t get the video game he covets for Christmas. Luke Cormican (“Teen Titans Go!”) directed this animated film, and Kinney wrote the screenplay. There’s enough humor, tension and relatable family dynamics to keep both longtime “Wimpy Kid” fans and little ones who are new to the series entertained. | President Vladimir V. Putin said on Friday that he would run for re-election in March, seeking a fifth term, which would extend his rule to 2030 and, if served to completion, make him Russia’s longest-serving leader since Catherine the Great in the late 18th century. | Just before Thanksgiving, a Silicon Valley giant appeared to implode before our eyes. A boardroom coup at OpenAI, the world’s hottest artificial intelligence company, pushed out its charismatic leader, Sam Altman. | The Houthis, Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen who have launched recent drone and missile attacks on Israeli and American targets, are emerging as an unpredictable and dangerous wild card in the Middle East — the proxies that Iran considers most suited to widening the war with Israel. | As the cease-fire in Gaza has ended and the fierce fighting there has resumed, the United States has issued sharper warnings to Israel’s leaders that they have a responsibility to avoid civilian casualties. | The New York Times Audio app is home to journalism and storytelling, and provides news, depth and serendipity.

In 2021, a group of hundreds of former senior defense and diplomatic officials in Israel published a report warning that this was a catastrophe — for Israel’s security, its democratic values, its international standing, and its very soul. And they argued that there was another way, that even without a Palestinian “partner for peace,” there was a huge amount Israel could do on its own to create the conditions for a two-state solution to emerge in the future. | The Times’s chief pop music critic, Jon Pareles, runs through some of his favorite albums of 2023: | Scandal, it seems, no longer stops politicians in their tracks. | Leonard Wickers, a 73-year-old carpenter, took a break from building a new house in South Houston to cast a ballot during early voting this week for the city’s mayoral runoff election. | Selected paperbacks from the Book Review, including titles by Dan Jones, Gaito Gazdanov, Ashleigh Bell Pedersen and more. | Warning: this episode contains strong language. | A selection of entertainment highlights this weekend, including the film “Poor Things.” | The presidents of Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania testified before a House committee on Tuesday about the state of antisemitism on their campuses. It did not go well for them. | A movie centered on domestic abuse isn’t an obvious crowd-pleaser, even when directed by and starring one of Italy’s most popular performers. | Jancee Dunn is out this week. I’m Alisha Haridasani Gupta, a reporter on the Well desk, filling in today. | Did you follow the news this week? Take our quiz to see how well you stack up with other Times readers. | The U.S. economy continued to pump out jobs in November, suggesting there is still juice left in a labor market that has been slowing almost imperceptibly since last year’s pandemic rebound. |  | For Jeanette Winterson, ghost stories are not old-fashioned or anachronistic in the modern world, but both cutting-edge and primal. In the introduction to her new collection, NIGHT SIDE OF THE RIVER: Ghost Stories (Grove, 306 pp., $27), she recalls some of her own inexplicable experiences with the uncanny, from the ghost of a writer friend materializing on her computer screen to her childhood premonition of her grandmother’s passing. Religion, and specifically faith in an afterlife, “can be considered as humankind’s first disruptive start-up,” she writes. “What’s being disrupted is death.” | Playing Prince Harry in the final season of Netflix’s “The Crown,” Luther Ford said he felt like royalty. | On a recent trip to the United Arab Emirates, I felt as if I’d entered a fever dream of green exuberance. It was more than two months before COP28, the annual global climate meeting now in progress in Dubai, but the country was already awash in environmental hype. On the highway, banners for an event hosted by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, the fossil fuel behemoth known as Adnoc, read: “Decarbonizing. Faster. Together.” A placard in my hotel bathroom asked me to conserve water by using the two-tiered flush, although the flush had only one tier. A friend’s utility bill was labeled “green bill” — although U.A.E. households have some of the biggest carbon footprints in the world. | In 2015, the USA cable network was a force in original programming. Dramas like “Suits,” “Mr. Robot” and “Royal Pains” either won awards or attracted big audiences. | I came to the work of the Norwegian writer Jon Fosse — who receives the Nobel Prize in Literature this week — by way of “Septology,” a novel cycle that began appearing in English just a few years ago. | There’s telling a bad joke. There’s bombing. And then there’s what happens to Nathan Fielder’s character, Asher Siegel, at the end of the fourth episode of “The Curse,” near the halfway point of a series that goes to disorienting extremes. | Good morning. It’s Friday. Today we’ll preview a symposium on the writer and civil rights activist James Baldwin. We’ll also find out why more than 500 tuba players are expected to gather in Rockefeller Center on Sunday. | Few filmmakers can claim the same heights of whimsy, artistry and storytelling as writer-director Hayao Miyazaki, whose modern-day fables seem to prove that having one’s head in the clouds isn’t a fault, but a virtue — in more ways than one. From his 1988 breakthrough “My Neighbor Totoro” to his 2001 Oscar-winning animated feature, “Spirited Away,” the sky is one of Miyazaki’s favorite playgrounds, where flight is about more than just elevation; it’s about transcendence. | All of a sudden, bunk beds seem to be everywhere: You see them in upscale beach and ski homes, as well as boutique hotels like Freehand, Moxy and Proper. | The season of mittens and hot chocolate is upon us and if you’d rather spend a tranquil afternoon beside a fire than brave the crowds at a big ski resort, these snowy getaways are for you. Picture yourself in a luxury treehouse in the woodlands of Vermont, or a quiet cottage in the Catskills, or a retro motor lodge near Grand Teton National Park. Consider a new boutique hotel in Rhode Island from which you can tour Gilded Age mansions trimmed for the holidays. Or check into a stately newcomer in Germany and browse Christmas markets in places you thought existed only in fairy tales. From Bavaria to Wyoming, winter wonderlands await. | Thousands of people had gathered amid the red dirt and golden grass of an Australian Outback cattle town to commemorate a watershed moment for Indigenous rights. Thomas Mayo was there to make a push for the future. | Recently, a friend who works outside of publishing described 2023 as a “year of survival”: no growth, no withering, just getting by. Those working within book publishing might have framed it in more profane terms, but I could still appreciate the sentiment. This year saw a centuries-old business contending with rounds of buyouts and layoffs, alongside an endless news cycle involving two brutal wars from which no authors, friends, enemies or strangers were immune from accountability for any unrehearsed sentiment they might voice in passing. Add to this the ongoing concern about how artificial intelligence will affect a business historically dependent upon human creativity — yet through it all, there was still the matter of making books, and their covers, to get on with. | A bitter battle is taking place between Big Tech and the free press over how to share in the income that news content generates for technology giants. The future of our news ecosystem, a linchpin of democracy, depends on the outcome. | The rapper Sexyy Red had the best year of her budding career in 2023, earning a spot on Drake’s newest album, concluding a 20-city tour and releasing her popular mixtape, “Hood Hottest Princess.” | When I open Instagram early in the morning, I might see a monkey nursing her baby, an ad for ribbed leggings, a montage about manifesting a pregnancy and a video of two men tenderly lifting a boy’s body onto a white sheet. | Scan the dairy case of any grocery store, and you’ll find rows upon rows of products with varying levels of fat. Nonfat, low-fat, whole: What’s the healthiest option? | Los Angeles gets a lot of attention for its blue-chip galleries, and in recent years some of New York’s most influential art dealers have opened spaces here, including David Zwirner, Marian Goodman, Lisson and Sean Kelly. | The Victorian-era “object lesson” was a method made popular in part by “Lessons on Objects,” a book by the English educational reformer Elizabeth Mayo, published in 1830. The book suggests presenting a series of objects to young students, in order to develop their “conceptive powers” — close observation of sealing wax, a thimble or a quill would, in this system, unlock abstract knowledge of the world.

(The name is adopted from the Portuguese dish carne de vinha d’alhos, in which meat, usually pork, is prepared in a vinegar and garlic marinade.) | Vintage cookbooks are a curious subdivision of the thriving antiquarian trade.

But most of that network’s members have yet to face justice, and most ISIS victims have yet to receive any compensation for their losses. | Many people were shocked when the Texas Supreme Court intervened recently to stop Kate Cox from getting an abortion in the state — an abortion needed to protect her health and future fertility after her fetus was diagnosed with a severe fetal anomaly in her second trimester. She ultimately traveled out of state to get the abortion she needed. | On Dec. 13, an election worker named Ruby Freeman took the stand in a Georgia courtroom and told the story of how her world was turned upside down by Rudy Giuliani.

In the past year, millions have played the game every day, and then shared, discussed and debated how they tried to win. | Last fall, Alexandra Duarte, who is now 16, went to see her endocrinologist at Texas Children’s Hospital, outside Houston. From age 10, she had been living with polycystic ovary syndrome and, more recently, prediabetes.

He gathered financial information, photos and videos and shared the material with The New York Times. | If companies want to leave Russia, the president is setting the terms — in ways that benefit his government, his elites and his war. | Given the kind of week, month and year that it’s been, you can consider it a Christmas gift of sorts that “Saturday Night Live” largely avoided topical comedy in its final new episode of 2023. Or perhaps it’s an unusual choice for an episode hosted by Kate McKinnon, who impersonated dozens of politicians and celebrities in her time on “S.N.L.,” but didn’t reprise them this week. | Artillery boomed, shaking the ground, as a couple scurried through the streets of Saké, their possessions balanced on their heads, in the embattled east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. | Year after year, with each new crop of “Survivor” castaways, it’s easy to see that they’re meant to represent a familiar cross-section of archetypes. | It was almost 1 a.m., and I was struggling to stay awake. For three days, I had followed the Tallac Hotshots while they worked on containing the Yeti fire near Happy Camp, Calif., and so far, this night shift had been quiet.

But across the U.S., migrant children do it anyway. | What is the point of “The Zone of Interest”? I’ve seen Jonathan Glazer’s movie twice, and each time I’ve returned to this question, something that I rarely feel compelled to ask. Movies exist because someone needs or wants to make art, tell a story, drive home a point, defend a cause, expose a wrong or simply make money.

Trump walked into a Georgia courthouse on Aug. 24 to be booked as part of his fourth criminal indictment, becoming the first former president (and only current presidential candidate) to have a mug shot taken, the picture seemed destined to become a symbol of this fraught, unprecedented moment in American history.

The incentives are a key part of President Biden’s strategy to reduce America’s reliance on countries like China for production of electric vehicles. | The European Central Bank on Thursday held interest rates steady for a second consecutive meeting, cementing the impression that rates have reached a peak in the bank’s effort to squash high inflation, but said rate cuts had not been discussed. | Hungary on Friday blocked the European Union from approving a financial aid package for Ukraine, though E.U. leaders agreed to officially open accession negotiations for Ukraine to join the bloc, an important breakthrough for Kyiv as it tries to bolster support from its allies. | How financially literate are you? Do you wish you knew more about managing money? | Living alone can be a choice or a pit stop, but one thing’s for sure: The rent is on you. Buying a home has been especially difficult over the past year, so more singles have been left to rely on leasing in a market where the typical renter is already rent burdened — that is, spending at least 30 percent of income on rent. | The “everything rally” has gone global, sending stocks and bonds soaring in Asia and Europe and lifting U.S. stock futures, after investors got their clearest signal yet that the Fed would begin cutting interest rates soon. Hopes are growing, too, on Thursday that other central banks will follow suit. | Europe’s two largest central banks kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday, and did not offer any indication that rate cuts were coming soon, diverging from the signals sent by the US. Federal Reserve the day before. | “Immediate Family,” Denny Tedesco’s amiable documentary, could use a subtitle, as it’s not an intimate domestic portrait. It focuses on the currently touring rock band that comprises session players who defined the sound of American pop and rock in the 1970s, while for decades playing with the likes of James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King, Stevie Nicks, Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon and more. | Cinephiles of a certain age have a Jean-Luc Godard film that when first seen, blew their minds. Mine was Godard’s low-budget foray into dystopian science fiction, “Alphaville.” | Making sense of the career of Jean-Luc Godard is both impossible and contrary to the spirit of his art. More than any other filmmaker, Godard, over six decades of features, sought with each new work to confound assumptions about how movies could look and sound. He long ago left behind intelligibility, at least in the conventional sense. | In 2017, New York City police officers killed Miguel Richards in his own apartment. They claimed that the killing was justified because Richards was holding a knife and what looked like a gun. | A major case in Texas this week drew attention to the question of who can get exempted from an abortion ban. Most states that have banned the procedure allow for rare exceptions, but while that might seem clear on paper, in practice, it’s far more ambiguous. | Since leaving Politico three years ago, the founders of the Washington news start-up Punchbowl News have made their mark with aggressive inside-the-Beltway coverage, breaking news on the Capitol riot, the messy ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the death of Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. | The New York Times Audio app is home to journalism and storytelling, and provides news, depth and serendipity. If you haven’t already, download it here — available to Times news subscribers on iOS — and sign up for our weekly newsletter. | This year’s Cannes Film Festival didn’t host the biggest movie of the year — “Barbie” — but the film’s director and co-writer, Greta Gerwig, will have a significant role at next year’s event. | A little after 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 23, a man stabbed three children and a woman outside a primary school in downtown Dublin. The woman and one of the children, a 5-year-old girl, were seriously injured. The suspect — who was injured while being subdued, and has yet to be interviewed — is originally from Algeria, a naturalized Irish citizen who has been here for two decades. The motive for the attack is still unclear. | Homing in on Lenox Hill, a young couple figured they could ‘pay the high end of our budget, and have a ready-made apartment, or the low end, where we had room to renovate.’ | The five men who make up Israel’s war cabinet have more than a century of military experience among them and decades of political and diplomatic know-how. | This is a good week to remember that in the hours after Senate Republicans refused to convict Donald Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, offered a hint of future comeuppance for the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, was still liable for everything he did as president. | Deep in her new book, “Oath and Honor,” Liz Cheney points out that the likeness of Clio, the Greek muse of history, is found in the Capitol’s National Statuary Hall. “Clio is depicted riding in the chariot of time, making notes in the book in her hand,” Cheney writes, “as a reminder that what we do in the Capitol Building is written in the pages of history.” | Given Republicans’ razor-thin majority, a recent wave of exits has the potential to lead to a significant shake-up in the 2024 election. | In a faintly stilted tone and with slightly awkward grammar, the American-accented voice on YouTube last month ridiculed Washington’s handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, claiming that the United States was unable to “play its role as a mediator like China” and “now finds itself in a position of significant isolation.” | J.R. Majewski, a Trump acolyte from Ohio whom House Republicans abandoned the first time he ran for Congress in the 2022 midterm elections after discrepancies in his military record emerged, is back as a candidate — and with some prominent G.O.P. names behind him. | It’s too early to start celebrating. That’s the Federal Reserve’s sober message — though given half a chance, the markets won’t heed it. | Have art books, will travel. And this year’s prime selections clock up a lot of visual, historical and personal mileage. We get an up-close tour through the Vermeer extravaganza that became the focus of international pilgrimage in 2023. The contemporary American artist Wade Guyton leads us, with a volume of his own drawings, through a lifetime fascination with the work of Édouard Manet. And at last we have the much-anticipated autobiographical account — actually an anti-memoir — of the long, continuing and indispensable career of one of our most influential and personable art writers. — HOLLAND COTTER | The Federal Reserve appears to be creeping closer to an outcome that its own staff economists viewed as unlikely just six months ago: lowering inflation back to a normal range without plunging the economy into a recession. | The holidays can be festive and joyous, but they can also be a strain financially. There’s pressure to buy gifts, travel, attend gatherings and “celebrate” days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. | As the world warms, the state is re-examining claims to its water that have gone unchallenged for generations. | The overflowing punch bowl is the standard beverage of a holiday party, boozy and bountiful. But what if not everyone is drinking — or wants the same kind of liquor? The drinks writer Rebekah Peppler has the solution with her “spiced holiday punch for everyone,” a customizable drink that starts with the same citrusy punch base, whether you add alcohol to it or not. | DealBook Summit includes conversations with business and policy leaders at the heart of today’s major stories, recorded live at the annual DealBook Summit event in New York City. | Watching the Republican primary debates can feel like a study in self sabotage. In the latest one, which Donald Trump skipped, the candidates spent most of their time attacking one another — not the guy who is 50 points ahead in the polls. | A Republican-led campaign against researchers who study disinformation online has zeroed in on the most prominent American government agency dedicated to countering propaganda and other information operations from terrorists and hostile nations. | The last tranche of episodes of “The Crown” has arrived on Netflix, the final six of 60 dating back to 2016, and I imagine I hear a sigh of relief from the show’s creator and primary writer, Peter Morgan. Not because the show is over but because he finally made his way past Diana, Princess of Wales, and could get back to the queen. | Chronic illness has a way of picking apart your mind and breaking your heart. | “A Charlie Brown Christmas” was a one-of-a-kind wonder when it premiered in 1965 and remains so almost 60 years later. Unlike the other jingle-belled baubles that TV throws down the chimney each year, it is melancholy and meditative. The animation is minimalist and subdued, full of grays and wafting snowflakes. I could wrap myself in the Vince Guaraldi jazz score like a quilt. | Good morning. It’s Thursday. Today we’ll find out when you can visit the Whitney Museum without paying the usual $30 for admission. We’ll also see what happened on the last day of testimony in Donald Trump’s civil trial in Manhattan. | The first thing to know about Jes Tom, a stand-up comedian who approaches the craft with a spirit of mischief, is that they “only say true things.” | Three hours into my latest visit to Key West, Fla., I listened as a mermaid explained why islanders are called “Conchs.” | If you’ve ever lost an hour to snickerdoodles that taste like pencil erasers, you’ll appreciate the exhaustive testing behind each recipe in “The Cookie That Changed My Life,” Nancy Silverton’s 11th cookbook. | “You know, I had the idealistic notion, when I was 20, that I was going into the theater,” Stephen Sondheim once said. “I wasn’t; I was going into show business, and I was a fool to think otherwise.” | Younger, sweeter and significantly less weird than his prior screen incarnations, the latest Willy Wonka — played by Timothée Chalamet — sets off on his adventure with a dream and a smile. For the next two hours, he keeps smiling, while sometimes singing, kind of dancing and concocting idiosyncratic treats like chocolates salted with, as Willy explains, “the bittersweet tears of a Russian clown.” Called hoverchocs, this particular delectable sends its nibblers flying. Alas, they weren’t given out at the press screening so I remained earthbound. | Cord Jefferson’s “American Fiction” is a cagey, cerebral dramedy about a joke that backfires on its author, a stone-faced literature professor named Thelonious Ellison (Jeffrey Wright) who becomes a pseudonymous success writing a potboiler he loathes. Tweedy, stubborn and aloof, Ellison, who goes by Monk, specializes in academic reworkings of Ancient Greek plays, i.e. books no one reads. | Have you ever spent quality time with a chicken? I raised them as a teenager, and I do not particularly recommend it. They can be smelly and dirty. They’re honestly not very bright. Yet they’re like living cartoons, weird and funny to watch, with spindly little legs holding up plump little bodies. They cluck disapprovingly when you take their eggs, and they’ll eat anything you dump in their yard (including, uh, chicken). | Unwind, stargaze and explore a dreamlike landscape in California’s high desert. |  | As Art Basel Miami Beach and the larger Miami Art Week have evolved over two decades, the hordes who come to see art have become more conscious about the clothes they are seen in. | When Stephen Le Duc posted on a Reddit forum proposing a meet-up at a music festival, he had no idea he would meet his future wife. | In my nearly three decades as an editor, author and former editor of The New York Times Book Review, a shorthand has often been used to describe contemporary authors — the Latino poet, the Indigenous novelist, the Black writer. Often this extends to a reductive way of viewing their work: This book is by an X person telling an X story. | Suzane Loi has been perched behind the cash register at The Coffee Mill in Oakland, Calif., for 27 years, watching the daily thrum of Grand Avenue through the cafe’s huge windows. | The subject of the painting lies naked on crumpled, white bedding. Her shapely breasts sit high, her ankles crossed. | “Class consciousness takes a vacation while we’re in the thrall of this book,” Barbara Grizzuti Harrison wrote in the Book Review in 1985, in her evaluation of the heiress Gloria Vanderbilt’s memoir “Once Upon a Time.” To be clear, Harrison was referring to the class consciousness of the reader, not the author. Vanderbilt demonstrates perfect awareness throughout her book that most young children don’t play with emerald tiaras and alligator jewel boxes lined in chestnut satin, or rely on the services of multiple butlers, or lose count of their own houses. Harrison’s point was that Vanderbilt’s talent with a pen — and perspective on her own economic altitude — allowed consumers of her tale to suspend their envy and engage with the reality of growing up in opulent neglect. | What books are on your night stand? | This term, the Supreme Court will reconsider America’s laissez-faire approach to regulating the internet, and in doing so it will address vital and new First Amendment questions. Can states stop social media sites from blocking certain content? Can the federal government pressure platforms to remove content it disagrees with? | President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia spent more than four hours on Thursday answering questions at his year-end news conference, resuming an annual tradition at a critical moment for his war in Ukraine. | The main reason Israel’s heavy bombardment of Gaza for nine weeks has not pushed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into Egypt is that country’s heavily fortified border and Cairo’s ironclad determination to keep it closed. | Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, set out to prove that Donald J. Trump had committed fraud. Mr. Trump took the stand to assail Ms. James. Lawyers on both sides screamed that their opponents were out of line and wasting time. | What do you think this image is saying? How does it relate to or comment on society or current events? Can you relate to it personally? What is your opinion of its message? | Four weeks before Hamas attacked Israel, a group of public defenders packed a bright, airy room in the Bronx for mandatory training on antisemitism. | Rabbi Elka Abrahamson put her hanukkiah in the window, its nine brass branches visible from the street of her Columbus, Ohio, home as darkness fell. Beside the menorah, a small Israeli flag stuck out of a mug filled with pens. | Good morning, dear connectors. Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This page contains spoilers for today’s puzzle. Solve Wordle first, or scroll at your own risk. | Hi busy bees! Welcome to today’s Spelling Bee forum. There are a number of terms that appear in both this article and other online discussions of the Spelling Bee; a glossary of those terms compiled by Monicat, a Times reader, can be found below. | Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now. | The word plutocrat has appeared in three articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on April 11 in the Opinion essay “Inequality Ahoy! On the Meaning of the Superyacht” by Paul Krugman: | After two weeks of furious debate, diplomats from nearly 200 countries at the U.N. climate summit in Dubai reached a sweeping agreement that explicitly called for “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” | Migrant children, put to work in one of the nation’s most dangerous jobs, are falling and dying. | Neanderthals were morning people, a new study suggests. And some humans today who like getting up early might credit genes they inherited from their Neanderthal ancestors. | In the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Vivek Ramaswamy, the entrepreneur and Republican presidential candidate, is pressing an unusual strategy: leaning into conspiracy theories. | Jump to: Today’s Theme | Tricky Clues | An article on Saturday about Thomas Mayo, a champion of the effort in Australia to give Indigenous people a voice in Parliament, included an inapt description of an amulet worn by Mr. Mayo. It is shaped like an Indigenous headdress typically worn by men, not women. | “There are other ways to think about A.I. — not simply as this uncontrollable temptation that undermines everything.” | The boleros, sons, danzóns and other popular Cuban song forms captured on the hit 1997 album “Buena Vista Social Club” — and in a 1999 Wim Wenders documentary about the musicians who made it — are a marvel: diabolically catchy, lively yet poetic, mesmerizingly complex beneath their seeming simplicity. | With one day to go until Congress plans to call it quits for the year and members head home for the holidays, the House got down to pressing business on Wednesday, using its precious remaining time to pass legislation to bring whole milk back to America’s school cafeterias. | An Australian appeals court on Thursday overturned the conviction of a woman who had spent 20 years in prison for killing her four young children, months after an official inquiry found that they had most likely died of natural causes. | When Barbara and Belvett Richards learned that the police had killed their son, they couldn’t understand it. How, on that September day in 2017, did their youngest child come to be shot in his own apartment by officers from the New York Police Department? | Federal labor regulators accused Starbucks on Wednesday of illegally closing 23 stores to suppress organizing activity and sought to force the company to reopen them. | Ruby Freeman, a former Georgia election worker, sat in a federal courtroom on Wednesday and told a jury: “Giuliani just messed me up, you know.” | Andre Braugher once joked to The New York Times that he had an “addiction” to working on critically acclaimed but little-watched shows. This may explain why lots of his work is not readily available — including, most surprisingly, the classic yet underappreciated cop show “Homicide: Life on the Street.” | The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed an $886 billion defense bill that would set Pentagon policy and provide a 5.2 percent pay raise for military personnel, defying the demands of Republicans who failed to attach a raft of deeply partisan restrictions on abortion, transgender care and diversity initiatives. | President Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill are seriously considering Republican demands for deeply restrictive immigration policies in exchange for billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine, a move that activists say would devastate America’s obligations to welcome desperate migrants fleeing war and oppression. | The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have begun an aggressive outreach campaign in the wake of growing evidence of the potential health risks that troops face from exposure to blasts from their own weapons. | A man was charged on Wednesday in the killing of Samantha Woll, a synagogue president who was found stabbed to death in October outside her Detroit home, the authorities said. | Around the world, authoritarianism is ascendant and democracy is in decline.",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times

In the post-Cold War landscape, with American power seemingly occupying the stage of history by itself, the memory of Nazi Germany’s genocide came to play a special cultural role in the self-understanding of the liberal West: We might not agree on the highest good, but we knew the highest evil, and arguments about its memory and meaning and implications were absolutely central to politics and culture. | In this week’s Modern Love essay, “Were We the ‘Fat Couple?,’” Courtenay Hameister realizes that the shame she feels about her body is insidious — wounding not only herself but the man she loves. | After several twists and turns this year, stock investors are in a celebratory mood. The S&P 500 set a new high for the year on Friday, a day after clocking its best month of 2023 in November, in a rally that quickly erased the benchmark index’s steep drop over the summer. | Fans in silver hats, pants and boots flooded movie theaters on Thursday night as they came to see Houston’s own Beyoncé on the silver screen. | Forty years after the American military attacked them, the people of Tropeang Phlong village in Cambodia were still traumatized. | Ultimately, a single wrong answer cost Rafael Benítez his job, the one he had coveted for most of his working life. The slight downturn in results, the disaffection of the players, the sudden loss of trust from those who had chosen to employ him — all of it, he believed, could be traced back to that single, relatively harmless, misstep. | Before there were the justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett, there was Sandra Day O’Connor. | “Dancing With Glass: The Piano Etudes” is titled a little misleadingly. The five dance selections on the program, now at the Joyce Theater as part of the Dance Reflections festival, are all set to piano études by Philip Glass. But before and after each, the pianist Maki Namekawa plays another of the Glass keyboard exercises. Really, the show is Glass with dancing. | It was the first time the cast members of “Sleeping Beauty” were rehearsing in their costumes, and they were amped up. “The energy is palpable!” the director Julie Atlas Muz said late last month as the actors gathered onstage at the Abrons Arts Center on the Lower East Side. | I was privileged to have been raised in a family who prized the arts, including works from cultures that were not our own. (We are of European ancestry.) Among the art in my childhood home was a significant collection of masks, statues, figurines and other objects from mostly West African cultures. My father, who acquired these pieces in the 1970s and ’80s through art dealers, has always taken pride in the idea that they were not “tourist art.” Most of the items date to the 19th and early 20th centuries. | On Thursday, the New York Philharmonic gave the New York premiere of a double piano concerto by a pop artist with classical and indie rock credentials. With the composer in attendance, the piece, lovingly crafted to show off the evening’s soloists, Katia and Marielle Labèque, had a strong claim as the evening’s centerpiece. | Ronald Fischetti, a pre-eminent criminal defense lawyer whose clients included, among many others, former President Donald J. Trump and a police officer accused of torturing a Haitian immigrant in a case that shocked New York City, died on Nov. 25 in Stamford, Conn. He was 87. | When Noam Or, 17, and his sister, Alma, 13, were released from Gaza on Saturday, they hoped that their parents might be there to welcome them. They were kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri on Oct. 7 and held hostage for 50 days, and they had not heard any news about their mother, Yonat, or their father, Dror. | Elon Musk is so smart that you have to wonder if trashing X, formerly Twitter, is somehow in his best interest. This couldn’t possibly be one giant mistake, could it? | To the Editor: | An appellate court in Illinois on Friday rejected Jussie Smollett’s challenge of his conviction on charges of filing a false police report about a racist and homophobic attack in 2019. | Sitting at No. 8 on this week’s Billboard Hot 100 — right between a sleek hit from the 20-year-old pop star Tate McRae and the latest offering from Taylor Swift’s vault — is a 65-year-old song, sung by an artist who is about to turn 79. Which, if you do the math (I’ll wait), means that artist recorded it when she was just 13. | As a young pastry cook in the early 2000s, my 2 p.m. shift at the restaurant Tatin in Baltimore would begin with a list of doughs to prepare for the next morning. | The vote on Friday to expel former Representative George Santos, Republican of New York, from Congress was an overwhelming rebuke from his colleagues, including many members of his own party. | Every Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation about something that matters, like today’s episode with Casey Newton and Kevin Roose. Listen wherever you get your podcasts. | Audiophiles, | Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who died Friday at 93, was the sort of figure once familiar in American political and judicial life: a moderate Republican ready to look for compromise and common ground. | In the crystal-clear waters of Kaneohe Bay, a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft that weighs over 130,000 pounds is stuck atop a fragile reef ecosystem. | How in the world do you make it in stand-up comedy? | A lawyer for former President Donald J. Trump argued in an Atlanta courtroom on Friday that putting his client on trial in the final stages of the 2024 presidential contest would be “the most effective election interference in the history of the United States.” | Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new tracks.

They sniffed out the approaching stranger before deciding to grant passage. Noah Kahan, a 26-year-old singer-songwriter who became an unlikely sensation this year, emerged from the house and corralled the pack with a series of gentle commands. | An Australian media company agreed to pay more than $360,000 to the outspoken libertarian economist and money manager Peter Schiff to resolve a defamation lawsuit he filed over a 2020 report on a boutique bank in Puerto Rico he once owned. | One adjective was invoked more than any other to describe Sandra Day O’Connor immediately after her death at 93 on Friday: “trailblazing.” | Berlin, a club that was a cornerstone of gay nightlife in Chicago, has closed after four decades. | Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken blamed Hamas for the broken truce on Friday and said that he was already seeing signs that Israel had taken new steps to protect civilians as it resumed its military campaign. | A few years ago, Jasmine Singh started volunteering at the Queens Botanical Garden, where she first learned about composting. She became hooked. | With dire warnings of planetary catastrophe and urgent pleas to protect vulnerable populations, world leaders on Friday implored one another to stop burning fossil fuels and swiftly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are `dangerously heating the planet. | After his expulsion from the House on Friday, George Santos faces an even more daunting and precarious challenge in a federal court on Long Island. | The federal indictment this week of an Indian citizen in an alleged murder-for-hire scheme targeting a Sikh separatist in New York threatens to damage ties between the United States and India just as the Biden administration has been courting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. | A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that civil lawsuits seeking to hold former President Donald J. Trump accountable for the violence that erupted at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, can move forward for now, rejecting a broad assertion of immunity that Mr. Trump’s legal team had invoked to try to get the cases dismissed. | Jordan Mailata, the 6-foot-8, 365-pound left tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles, was nervous for his next matchup. It was August, and he was heading into the recording studio to duet with the Godmother of Soul, Patti LaBelle. | In the end, it may have been the luxury goods that brought down George Santos. | When Kiss plays Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, it will bring down the curtain on the band’s End of the Road farewell tour, which began in January 2019. “We’re gonna go out on top,” the bassist Gene Simmons said last year during an interview with the Los Angeles radio station KLOS-FM. There will be no more Kiss tours, he’s vowed, not ever. | “Wolfram, wake up!” came a shout from the highest box seats of the Metropolitan Opera. “The spring is polluted!” | Should the blessed day ever arrive when Donald Trump is sent to federal prison, only one of his acolytes has earned the right to share his cell: George Santos, who on Friday became the sixth person in history to be expelled from the House of Representatives, more than seven months after he was first charged with crimes including fraud and money laundering. (He’s pleaded not guilty.) A clout-chasing con man obsessed with celebrity, driven into politics not by ideology but by vanity and the promise of proximity to rich marks, Santos is a pure product of Trump’s Republican Party. “At nearly every opportunity, he placed his desire for private gain above his duty to uphold the Constitution, federal law and ethical principles,” said a House Ethics Committee report about Santos released last month. He’s a true child of the MAGA movement. | One performer is missing from the current Parisian run of Rébecca Chaillon’s “Carte Noire Named Desire,” an arresting show about the experiences of Black women in France. When the actors gathered onstage for a dinner scene at the Odéon–Théâtre de l’Europe this week, Fatou Siby’s chair remained empty, and a monologue inspired by her life was delivered instead by a guest artist. | U.S. oil production has hit a record level, but the surge also poses risks. | The expulsion of George Santos from Congress on Friday swept away one major political headache for Republicans, but it immediately set the stage for another: The party will have to defend his vulnerable seat in a special election early next year. | In “The Crown,” the story of Diana, Princess of Wales, could only ever end one way. For Elizabeth Debicki, who played Diana in Seasons 5 and 6 of the Netflix series about the British royal family, the scenes that anticipate the inexorable tragedy in a Paris tunnel were both easy and terrible to shoot. | To the Editor: | In “Anatomy of a Scene,” we ask directors to reveal the secrets that go into making key scenes in their movies. See new episodes in the series on Fridays. You can also watch our collection of more than 150 videos on YouTube and subscribe to our YouTube channel. | The director Todd Haynes narrates a sequence from his film starring Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore. | Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, suggested on Friday that the central bank may be done raising interest rates if inflation and the economy continue to cool as expected, saying that central bankers could raise interest rates further if that became necessary. | Kai Ko’s transgressive boys-will-be-boys adventure is tonally uneasy and deliciously pulp. Fresh off their high school graduation, three friends — Wang (Kent Tsai), Han (Edison Song), and Chang (Berant Zhu) — dare each other to share their deepest, darkest secrets. Chang confesses to a rape, while Han shares a murder he committed for fun. The nerdy Wang sheepishly admits to cheating on a test. As a prank, the two friends goad Wang to commit an actual crime: Wang smashes a bottle across a gangster’s head. What was meant to be a memorable night becomes an evening of doom. | On Jan. 20, 1957, a 14-year-old pianist named Daniel Barenboim made his Carnegie Hall debut, playing a Prokofiev concerto. In 1968, just 25, he appeared at the hall for the first time as a conductor. | Every month, streaming services add movies and TV shows to its library. Here are our picks for some of December’s most promising new titles. (Note: Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.

Ron DeSantis of Florida and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California was not, despite its name, a debate. Oh, there was “debating,” or the cable-news version: Sniping, insults, cross-talk and the delivery of packaged attacks between the red and blue leaders of states known for their oranges. | The House voted to expel Representative George Santos of New York from office, with 311 votes in favor. | Reader, please select your own corny first line for this article: | Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman on the United States Supreme Court, a rancher’s daughter who wielded great power over American law from her seat at the center of the court’s ideological spectrum, died on Friday in Phoenix. She was 93. | A few weeks ago, Jung Kook — a member of the world-beating K-pop group BTS — released his solo debut album, “Golden,” a sleek affair notable for high-profile collaborators on its tracks and behind the scenes, as well as for the fact that it’s sung fully in English. | American oil fields are gushing again, helping to drive down fuel prices but also threatening to undercut efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. | George Santos, the New York Republican congressman whose tapestry of lies and schemes made him a figure of national ridicule and the subject of a 23-count federal indictment, was expelled from the House on Friday after a decisive bipartisan vote by his peers. | Happy Friday. | It isn’t dead. It’s more important than ever. | A flurry of states now require financial literacy classes for high school students, covering topics like budgeting, saving and managing debt. | I rewound the final beat of this week’s episode of “The Curse” immediately after first watching it, and have found myself revisiting it many times since. | The fragile truce between Israel and Hamas collapsed on Friday morning because the adversaries could not find common ground for further exchanges of hostages and prisoners, according to two Israeli officials involved in the talks. | The Biden administration proposed new rules on Friday aimed at shifting more production of electric vehicle batteries and the materials that power them to the United States, in an attempt to build up a strategic industry now dominated by China. | A Russian court on Friday extended the detention of an editor working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a broadcaster funded by the American government, who was arrested in October on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent. | Christmas came early this year in Dublin, but too late for a beloved adopted son. | Thursday was meant to be a big day for Tesla and its investors, as the electric vehicle maker finally began delivering to customers its much-ballyhooed Cybertruck pickup — its first new model in more than three years. | From the first episode of ABC’s “The Golden Bachelor,” the stakes were instantly higher than in all the other versions of the dating competition. Gerry Turner, the 72-year-old retired widower, would pick a partner from contestants in their 60s and 70s, many of whom had already had one “love of their life.” | Israeli officials obtained Hamas’s battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show. But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out. | Good morning. There’s turkey stock in the freezer, but the rest of the Thanksgiving leftovers are gone: made into stews, sandwiches, quesadillas, beds for evening eggs. It was a lovely week of feasting. Now we’re on to Cookie Week, holiday ham and the sprint to the end of the year. Buckle up! | Valery Gergiev, the star Russian maestro and prominent supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin, was tapped on Friday to lead the storied Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, the Russian government announced. | Three American climbers lay in the dark, sharing a custom-made sleeping bag on a portable ledge dangling from a massive cliff high in the Himalayas. They were anchored to the north face of Mount Jannu, one of the world’s biggest, sheerest rock walls. | With the flow of holiday releases now akin to the gush exploding out of a broken fire hydrant, it’s tough to figure out which movies deserve your attention: Hallmark alone has 42 new holiday movies this year; add the Lifetime and Great American Family channels, and you will be busy through Valentine’s Day. This roundup will at least get you started with many of the major streamers’ new offerings. | From the start of the ethnic conflict that turned a state in India’s northeast into a war zone, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to shift the focus from the calamity. | In a far corner of the temporary village housing the United Nations climate summit, the world’s largest cartel of fossil fuel producers plied skeptical young activists with chocolate and free pens. | Should you rent or buy your next home? | The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, pledged to redouble efforts to shift the world’s most populous country away from fossil fuels and accelerate the development of renewable energy. | The New York Times Audio app is home to journalism and storytelling, and provides news, depth and serendipity. If you haven’t already, download it here — available to Times news subscribers on iOS — and sign up for our weekly newsletter. | For many millennials, buying a home has become almost entirely out of reach. Average 30-year mortgage rates are hovering around 7 percent — the highest they’ve been since 2007 — largely because of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation. | “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé” is out today. It’s a nearly three-hour documentary of the pop icon’s record-breaking summer tour and provides audiences with both a front-row seat and behind-the-scenes look at the show. J Wortham and Salamishah Tillet discuss what the film means for the artist at the height of her powers. | THE SAINT OF BRIGHT DOORS (Tordotcom, 356 pp., $27.99), by Vajra Chandrasekera, is the best book I’ve read all year. Protean, singular, original, it forces me to come up with the most baffling comparisons, like: What if “Disco Elysium” were written by Sofia Samatar? At the same time, all you need to know about it is contained in its opening: | It’s that time of year again. The Thanksgiving leftovers are gone, and the December holidays beckon. | There has almost been too much to read since Henry Kissinger, the former national security adviser and secretary of state who served under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, died on Wednesday. But I think the best obituaries and retrospectives on Kissinger have emphasized his paramount role in the spread of human misery across the globe, in the name of realpolitik and what he determined were America’s “national interests.” | A friend of mine, a couples counselor, stopped by to see me after a long week. She sank into my couch, closed her eyes and said: “You know what phrase I wish I could ban couples from saying? ‘I never said that.’” | The first sign that something was amiss came in the form of three police cruisers idling, unbidden, in the lot behind the Islamic Society of Vermont, the state’s largest mosque, last Saturday night in South Burlington. Usually there would be only one cop, paid for by the mosque during gatherings like the community potluck being held that evening. | Some of the biggest names in commercial real estate, like Brookfield and Blackstone, have stopped paying mortgages, allowing lenders to repossess buildings. | Selections from the Weekend section, including a review of John Woo’s latest film, “Silent Night.” | In the United States, annual flu vaccine campaigns begin in early September, before temperatures start to cool down and the cycle of people catching and spreading virus commences. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that most people get vaccinated as soon as updated shots become available for the season. And in an ideal world everyone would be vaccinated by the end of October. | The drama at OpenAI is not over. Kevin and Casey take stock of new information they’ve gathered since last week, and look at how other artificial intelligence companies are trying to capitalize on the debacle. Then, why people are still buying cryptocurrency even after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and its founder pleaded guilty to money laundering violations. And finally, three ways A.I. is ruining web search. Or is it? | Did you follow the news this week? Take our quiz to see how well you stack up with other Times readers. | Selected paperbacks from the Book Review, including titles by Evette Dionne, Erica Jong, Chetna Maroo and more.  | Thursday marked the one-year anniversary of the release of ChatGPT.

Sam Altman, only for him to return several days later. | To add some holiday magic to your mantel, try creating a miniature winter scene. | Forcing bulbs is easy: Here's how architect Elizabeth Roberts does it. | What do you do when you need a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life? When you need to recharge your mental and physical batteries? Have you ever gone on a silent walk? | Shou Chew, TikTok’s chief executive, has been getting personally involved in efforts to address concerns that the app has fueled anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, in a sign of how seriously the company is taking the criticism. | Here's how the event designer Jung Lee makes a gorgeous holiday wreath for next to nothing. | A video of security officers wrestling a protester to the floor in the lobby of the Jackson Lake Lodge in Wyoming, outside the Federal Reserve’s most closely watched annual conference, clocked more than a million views. | As we head into COP28, the annual global meeting on climate change underway in Dubai, there are two dominating schools of thought, both of which are wrong. One says the future is hopeless and our grandchildren are doomed to suffer on a burning planet. The other says we’re all going to be fine because we already have everything we need to solve climate change. | Strongmen are making a comeback. The hyperlibertarian Javier Milei in Argentina and the anti-immigration Geert Wilders in the Netherlands are among a growing group of recently elected leaders who promise to break a few rules, shake up democratic institutions and spread a populist message. | It’s remarkable how fixated Ron DeSantis and Gavin Newsom have been on each other. It’s weird. These two opposite-party governors from opposite coasts of the country have been sparring — repeatedly, haughtily, naughtily — for more than two years. If their debate on Thursday night had been the climactic scene in a Hollywood rom-com, Newsom would have left his lectern, marched purposefully over to DeSantis, cut him off mid-insult and swept him into his arms, the tension between them revealed as equal parts ideological and erotic. | A novel titled “Prophet Song” promises some degree of timeliness, and, indeed, it comes at a moment when the fear it addresses is daily in the news: that the social contract is about to break, that what we think of as ordinary life is about to be transformed into a constant existential struggle, which will be played out not in a state of nature but in something arguably worse, at the fault line between opposing ideologies. This week, the novel, by the Irish writer Paul Lynch, won the Booker Prize. | Eager for bargains, American consumers filled their shopping carts last weekend with holiday gifts. But it isn’t yet clear if that means this will be a successful season for retailers. | A cold wind was blowing across the steppe, but Sapura Kadyrova didn’t see the point in bundling up. She was waiting to greet her son, who was arriving home from the war in a crimson government-issued casket. | When Michael and Jennifer Monteiro bought a house on Cape Cod, they wanted more than just a vacation home near the beach in Massachusetts: They were determined to own something that reflected cutting-edge sustainability. | One Massachusetts couple decided to use the most cutting-edge green technologies in their new beach house. It was more challenging than they expected. | I had a terrific movie year — you? I saw hundreds of new films with a variety of plots and styles made on every imaginable scale and budget. Some were from newcomers like A.V. Rockwell and others from the ever-new Martin Scorsese. Some you’ve heard of or will, while others scarcely made a ripple. Some were released by independents like A24 and the tiny KimStim; others came from tech companies and still others from what are now often called legacy studios, a vaguely eulogistic term that suggests influence but also obsolescence. | The rapper Kendrick Lamar is the latest celebrity to descend on Brooklyn, with his purchase of a sprawling duplex penthouse near the waterfront in Brooklyn Heights. | Good morning. It’s Friday. Today we’ll find out how one kind of snowflake was overhauled and why it has been 655 days — and counting — since a substantial amount of another kind of snowflake was seen in Central Park. | When humans first soared in the air, it was not aboard an airplane. It was in a hot air balloon, in 1783 — 120 years before the Wright brothers’ maiden flight. Since then, biplanes have evolved into jumbo jets, but the basic technology behind ballooning has hardly changed: cloth, basket, burner, ballast and ground crew. | When John Woo was a child, living in the dangerous slums of Hong Kong, he had two sanctuaries: the church and the movie theater. Both provided respite from a world of poverty and intense violence. | THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMASBy Clement C. MooreIllustrated by Ella BeechThe Folio Society. 42 pp. $60.(Ages 3 and up) | Daniel Sweren-Becker’s KILL SHOW (Harper, 240 pp., $27.99) is both an entertaining mystery and a bracing examination of how true crime has warped real-life investigations. It’s also a provocative reminder of how people behave differently, and often disastrously, when they’re in the spotlight. | WHEN THE NEW York chef and restaurateur Angie Mar was developing the dessert menu for her new Manhattan restaurant, Le B — where she serves an opulent take on continental cuisine — she wasn’t interested in subtlety. “I always love excess,” says Mar, 41. “And when I think about a ’70s dinner party, I think about excess.” She decided to revive two of the decade’s most popular desserts: the soufflé and the showstopping Black Forest cake. Mar’s riff on the latter — traditionally a chocolate cake layered with kirsch-soaked cherries and whipped cream — pairs oozing, gastrique-infused Bings with fudgy chocolate, a fluffy quenelle of rum-spiked Chantilly cream and a smattering of lacy almond tuiles. Meticulously composed and a little bit weird, the dish wouldn’t look out of place in Salvador Dalí’s 1973 cookbook, “Les Dîners de Gala,” a chronicle of the Surrealist feasts he hosted with Gala Dalí, his wife and muse. | When I was in sixth grade, I made a decision that changed the course of my life. I decided not to try out for the middle school swim team. I know that might not sound like a big deal, but it was. As a grade schooler I was a standout swimmer — strong shoulders and back, and well-muscled legs that powered me through the water with ease and speed. I was disciplined, obsessive. My form was excellent. My coach saw potential. | HERE IS THE myth of how the punk singer and poet Patti Smith vanished for 16 years: In 1979, at the age of 32, she said goodbye to her band, the public and New York for a life with the man who would soon be her husband, the guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith, in his hometown of Detroit. Soon after, they moved to the suburbs — the very place punks were supposed to be trying to escape, the turf of those enemies, Mom and Dad — and bought a three-bedroom Tudor house in St. Clair Shores, where they raised two children; where they became Mom and Dad. This idyll didn’t last. Fred Smith died young, of heart failure, in 1994 and, after a period of mourning, Patti Smith returned to New York and the music scene. Of her time away from her career, she told The Times in 1995, “There’s no job harder than being a wife and a mother.” | This has been a banner year for historical fiction and it’s not over yet. Here, for your holiday consideration, are six recently published historical novels that would make fine gifts — or fine rewards when you reach the end of that long shopping list. | Abdullah Hammoud, the 33-year-old mayor of Dearborn, Mich., feels the painful weight of a war being fought 6,000 miles away. | Romance glows twice as bright when nights grow long. I ushered in winter’s first frost with Alix E. Harrow’s STARLING HOUSE (Tor, 320 pp., $28.99), which is perfect for when you want that Shirley Jackson creepy manor sauce drizzled over the small-town romance plot, in a way that’s probably not healthy but is absolutely delicious. | There’s a scene in the 1991 documentary “Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse” in which Francis Ford Coppola — parked in a director’s chair in front of a banyan tree in the Philippines, shirtless and hairy-chested — expounds upon his work in progress, “Apocalypse Now.” | With the holidays upon us after a long and fraught year, carving out a few hours to lose yourself in a good mystery feels restorative. Here are crime novels of all categories, new and old, which will help you do just that. | Shining out from the Instagram slag heap, amid the endless A.I. selfies and reaction reels, is an account so quiet in presence and noble in intention that it is sometimes hard to believe it exists. The account, @theAIDSmemorial, is an evolving testament, told in photographs, videos and user stories, to lives lost to a devastating and, it can occasionally seem, forgotten epidemic. | A great cookie platter should excite and inspire, from first electric sight to last delicious bite. Every December, New York Times Cooking unveils showstopping cookies and videos for our annual Cookie Week. This year’s class is especially dazzling, with chewy gingerbread blondies, buttery lemon swoops and spicy hot chocolate crinkles, to name a few. Watch the videos below (or on YouTube), save the recipes on NYT Cooking, then make one — or make them all. VAUGHN VREELAND | In Megan Barnard’s debut novel, “Jezebel,” the titular wicked queen of biblical lore gets a spirited makeover. Reaching back to a time “before her name was a slur,” the novel begins when the princess is 6 years old, learning from her father that she can never take his place as the king of Tyre — girls can only become queens. “Queens are not important,” she argues back. “They are not remembered.” From a young age, anger courses through Jezebel “like a thunderstorm that broke open the sea’s depths.” | King Charles III challenged a gathering of world leaders to take “genuine transformational action” to slow the spiral of greenhouse gas emissions, declaring that “the hope of the world rests on the decisions you must take.” | Use your imagination to write the opening of a short story or poem inspired by this illustration or, describe a memory from your own life that this image makes you think of. | Shane MacGowan’s timeless love letter to New York announces itself from a cockeyed vantage — “It was Christmas Eve, babe, in the drunk tank” — before name-checking the city’s many riches: Frank Sinatra, Broadway, cars big as bars and rivers of gold. “Fairytale of New York” also immortalizes a specific group of people doing a specific thing: | Welcome to The Wordle Review.

And don’t miss Olga Balema’s punkest show in town. | Australian Swifties cannot purchase tickets to the Sydney or Melbourne dates of Taylor Swift’s “Eras Tour” for love nor money — unless they leave the country. | Israeli officials obtained Hamas’s battle plan for the devastating Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, according to documents, emails and interviews, but they dismissed it as aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out. In fact, Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision. | A weeklong cease-fire in the Gaza Strip collapsed on Friday morning, with both Israel and Hamas blaming the other for the breakdown of the fragile truce that had allowed for the exchange of scores of hostages and prisoners, and had briefly raised hopes for a more lasting halt to the fighting. | What’s in a number? | It was Verity Jean Louise Elks who first asked to make things official. | An article on Wednesday about a drug that could extend the life expectancy of dogs misstated the name of the hormone abbreviated as IGF-1. It is insulinlike growth factor-1, not insulin growth factor-1. | “It looks like something lowered from the lunar module to collect rocks on the moon.” | Dating Jason was such a relief. At 43, I had been in love only once before with a man who sat in the passenger seat of my car (when I was much thinner than I am today) and poked his finger into my splayed thigh, as if to say, “You’re going to take care of that, right?” | Shortly after matching on the dating app Bumble, followed by a 90-minute “screening” phone call in June 2022, Christie Lynn Houlihan and Rahul Dev Chatterjee had their first date in Houston. | Joan Ellen Weidner and John Christopher Meyer III were the only ones unattached on a weeklong Princeton Class of 1969 National Parks hiking trip in October 2022. It was their first vacation alone since their spouses had died. | When Julia Margaux Elbaba and Dr. Matthew George Nevulis matched on Bumble in early 2019, neither was in a position to make a long-distance relationship work. Dr. Nevulis lived in Charlottesville, Va., where he was completing his medical residency at the University of Virginia. Ms. Elbaba was traveling the world as a professional tennis player, with a home base in Oyster Bay, N.Y. | For an hour and a half on Thursday night, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California shouted at and interrupted each other, trying to leave an impression on Fox News viewers beyond the din of their slugfest. | The opening night of a revival of Richard Wagner’s “Tannhäuser” at the Metropolitan Opera in New York was interrupted Thursday night by climate protesters shouting “No Opera” from the balconies on both sides of the opera house. | Earlier this month, the naval aircraft overshot a runway and landed in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Divers stabilized the plane to prevent it from lodging deeper into the reef. | ACROSTIC — Today’s passage is from the poem, “The Hill We Climb,” which Amanda Gorman wrote for and read at President Biden’s inauguration in 2021. She was 22 when Dr. Jill Biden, the incoming first lady, chose her for the honor. Gorman’s reading was nearly scuttled by fears of Covid-19 and political violence, but she prevailed with a recitation that I recall clearly and fondly. (The rest of that ceremony? Not so much.) | Jump to: Tricky Clues | The debut season of “The Golden Bachelor,” ABC’s dating show featuring contestants 60 and older, concluded on Thursday night with its lead, Gerry Turner, a 72-year-old retiree and pickleball enthusiast from Indiana, proposing to Theresa Nist, 70, a financial services professional from Shrewsbury, N.J. | “Financing is complicated when it comes to the arts,” says a low-budget filmmaker in Jen Silverman’s “Spain.” That’s hardly news, but the clever if murky play, which had its world premiere on Thursday at Second Stage Theater, offers a solution: Let the Soviets foot the bill. | A 3-year-old boy was killed in a hit and run in Queens on Wednesday night, the fifth child to be killed by a vehicle this year in New York City. | Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is accustomed to crushing Democrats in his home state. | Guy Philippe, the former Haitian police commander, politician and rebel who staged a coup against his country’s then-president in 2004 and served six years in a U.S. federal prison for money laundering, was deported to Haiti on Thursday, according to one of his attorneys in Haiti, Emmanuel Jeanty. | As Hamas released more hostages on Thursday under a fragile truce deal, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met with Israeli leaders and urged them to take concrete steps to reduce civilian deaths before the military resumed an expected offensive against Hamas in Gaza. | On a rainy night in June, President Biden toasted Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India during a state dinner at the White House, celebrating “two great friends, and two great powers” — a gesture of flattery for a leader he has enlisted to help the United States check China’s ambition and counter Russia’s aggression. | First, Jeff Bezos’ new megayacht was too big to pass under a bridge in the Netherlands. Now, the massive vessel’s size — it’s more than 400 feet long — has played a role in preventing it from keeping company with other private yachts in Port Everglades, Fla., where it is anchored.  | President Biden hosted President João Lourenço of Angola at the White House on Thursday, promoting a major U.S. investment in the country as he tries to shore up his pledge to revitalize relations with African nations. | Florida’s Republican Party found itself roiled on Thursday after the police said they were investigating an accusation made two months ago that the party’s chairman had engaged in sexual battery. | Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state who died this week, was a go-to adviser for many American presidents over his decades in politics. | A federal judge in Montana on Thursday blocked a statewide ban of TikTok from taking effect next year, at least temporarily preventing the nation’s first such prohibition on the popular video app. | Israeli officials obtained Hamas’s battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show. But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out. | Six former correctional officers at a West Virginia jail are facing federal charges in the death of an inmate who was assaulted by a group of guards and died last year, the Justice Department said Thursday. | Donald Trump hasn’t talked much about policy in this election cycle, except for vague assertions that he’ll somehow bring back low unemployment and low inflation — which, by the way, has already happened. (Unemployment has been at or below 4 percent for almost two years. Thursday’s report on consumer spending showed the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of underlying inflation getting close to its 2 percent target.) Most of his energy seems to be devoted to the prospect of wreaking revenge on his political opponents, whom he promises to “root out” like “vermin.”",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New

Hyper-polished and spare; chaotic and highly composed. | This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times. | A​ clash between gunmen and members of a small farming community in central Mexico has left at least 14 people dead, the state authorities said Saturday, casting the violence as a gang extortion attempt that backfired when residents fought back. | When a historian wrote an essay the other day warning that the election of former President Donald J. Trump next year could lead to dictatorship, one of Mr. Trump’s allies quickly responded by calling for the historian to be sent to prison. | The Iran-backed Houthi militia that controls northern Yemen threatened on Saturday to block any vessel sailing to Israeli ports, expanding its earlier warnings to ships passing through the Red and Arabian Seas. | Maria Emilia Martin, who founded “Latino USA,” which is now the longest-running public radio show in the country covering Latino communities, and who trained and mentored hundreds of journalists in Central and South America, died on Dec. 2 at a hospice facility in Austin, Texas.

They are often on opposite sides in major cases, and they certainly have starkly different views about gun rights. | We know — 2023 isn’t over yet. There are still many holiday parties and cookie swaps and family dinners to barrel through. But these recipes have been such major hits with our readers that we figure we’re good to share them now. For that holiday party, how about roasted cauliflower with crispy Parmesan, which works as either a crowd-pleasing veggie side or part of an appetizer spread? For the cookie swap, you’ll want to refer to our 2023 Cookie Week recipes, but any sweet treat would be perfect paired with a bubbly tinto de verano. (Yes, summer is in the drink’s name, but this refreshing mix of red wine and citrus soda is delightful year-round.) And you have several options for that family dinner: white chicken chili (above), shrimp tacos or this perfect eggplant Parmesan that’s already dressed in red and green. | The next United Nations climate change summit appears set to take place in Azerbaijan, a spokesman for the country said Saturday, resolving a bitter, monthslong political standoff over which nation should host the talks in 2024. | Much of Gaza lies in ruins, with its people pushed from their homes by Israeli bombardment and the death toll climbing ever higher. On the ground, Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years, has largely vanished, other than when its fighters pop up to attack Israeli tanks or fire rockets at Israel. | This feature is part of a series called Turning Points, in which writers explore what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. You can read more by visiting the Turning Points series page. | I am a 48-year-old biracial daughter of a Thai immigrant and a white woman who divorced when I was 5. My father moved back to Thailand after the separation, and I didn’t see him again for 26 years. After the divorce, my maternal family was eager to erase my Southeast Asian heritage. I was baptized in my grandparents’ church, and my Muslim surname was legally changed to my mother’s family name. Although I greatly resemble my father, we did not acknowledge him in any way. I have since forgotten many of the Thai customs I grew up with before my parents’ divorce. Culturally speaking, I am a Midwestern-born Colorado resident with little to show for my Thai heritage. | A federal safety agency warned this week that small, powerful magnets have been linked to seven deaths after they were ingested, announcing one company’s voluntary recall of a set that contained such magnets and issuing warnings about six other companies with similar products. | When Meta sued the Federal Trade Commission last week — the social networking giant’s latest effort to block new restrictions on its monetization of user data — it used an increasingly common argument against government regulators: The complaint alleged that the structure of the F.T.C. was unconstitutional and that its in-house trials were invalid. | Just south of Baghdad, the urban sprawl gives way to glimpses of green, with lush date palm groves bordering the Euphrates River. But few risk spending much time there. Not even the Iraqi military or government officials venture without permission. | Dear readers, | The Israeli military struck targets from the air, ground and sea across the Gaza Strip overnight into Saturday, it said, as air-raid sirens warning of incoming rocket fire blared in Israeli communities near Gaza. | Something “This American Life” had never done before: true stories told in the form of a game show. | The men came alone that morning, leaving families and sheep behind, and climbed the hill to see what was left of their village. On the sun-bleached crest, they found a scene of wreckage: The windows of the makeshift clinic had been smashed, household furniture lay shattered; sections of the schoolhouse had been burned to ash. There were drifts of clothing and stray shoes spread on the ground throughout the abandoned village, small things dropped in haste when the families fled. | Over the last few months, the incredulous question — How can Donald Trump possibly be leading the polls; there must be some mistake — has given way to the clear reality: Something in American life would need to change for Joe Biden to be favored for re-election in November 2024. | This column was updated to reflect the news.  | Homelessness is an American tragedy, but it’s not hopeless. In a recent column, I explored how Houston has become a national model by reducing homelessness by more than 60 percent. | To the Editor: | Three weeks left in the year, but don’t be fooled: December has its own peculiar velocity. Weeks seem to pass more quickly as the month goes on, a downhill sled picking up speed. Depending on your orientation to the holidays, the end of 2023 or time’s passage in general, this could feel exciting or it could be bewildering. Here we go, ready or not! Into the small hours of the year, into the dawn of another one. | The idea that fossil fuels have a long-term future in the global economy is one that is anathema to the many environmentalists attending the U.N. climate summit being hosted by the United Arab Emirates. But to two Canadian premiers who are also attending, the idea is gospel, and the conference is an ideal place to mint converts. | On a recent cloudy afternoon, the remains of three Russian soldiers were buried in virtual secrecy in a small corner of northeastern France. There were no Russian officials at the funeral. No Russian flag was hoisted. No Russian anthem was played. | A woman dressed as a dugong, a rare marine mammal, beseeched passers-by to end the burning of fossil fuels. Protesters wiped away tears as they recited the names of Palestinians killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. | Dubai is full of futuristic, glazed skyscrapers. That’s problematic, from a sustainability perspective, in a city where temperatures regularly climb past 100 degrees Fahrenheit for several months each year. Air-conditioning can be so strong in the summer that some people wear jackets and scarves inside. | Miami Art Week is in full swing in South Florida, anchored by Art Basel Miami Beach. We were on the scene for parties in the area that featured the performer Janelle Monáe, the filmmaker Harmony Korine and prominent figures from the art world. | As a birthday present for Tyler Perry last year, a mutual acquaintance arranged for him to meet one of his heroes, Norman Lear. Perry grew up watching Lear’s groundbreaking television shows, and was awed by how several presented a fuller version of Black lives onto American television screens for the first time. | When Pam Berns mailed a few checks to pay bills, she had no idea such a routine task would throw her small publishing business into chaos. | Send questions about the office, money, careers and work-life balance to workfriend@nytimes.com. Include your name and location, or a request to remain anonymous. Letters may be edited. | Here’s what bank security employees might be thinking when deciding whether to shut down a customer account after detecting unusual activity. | Toby Gould was an early adopter. In September, Mr. Gould, 78, went to a pharmacy in Hyannis, Mass., to get one of the new vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus, known as R.S.V. He has asthma, which would heighten his risk of serious illness if he were to be infected. | Q: We live in a gated townhouse community in Essex County, N.J. When we purchased our unit two years ago, there were tennis courts behind our deck, which never caused a problem. But now the two courts closest to us have been converted to pickleball courts, and the noise from the balls and the players is loud, disturbing our quality of life. Play starts at 7:30 a.m. on some days. We can’t use our deck, and our bedroom faces the courts, so we can’t sleep with the windows open. The overhead lights are on until 8:30 p.m., shining into the back of our house. We have asked the property owner’s association to move the courts farther away and to put up soundproofing, but we’ve been ignored. What action can we take? | When the “Sandman” author Neil Gaiman was approached in 2013 about reading “A Christmas Carol” at the New York Public Library, his requirements were simple. | Ask Minnesotans about the state’s official flag, and prepare for a crush of critiques. | What’s on your own best-of list for 2023? Think about everything you consumed, regardless of genre: yes, the best thing you watched, but also the best thing you ate, the best advice you received, the best app you discovered, the best line you encountered in a movie, the best book you read that’s been sitting on your shelf for over a decade, the best change you made to your evening routine. (For inspiration, check out reader favorites from last year.) | Big Oil faces a tiny foe on the streets of Asia and Africa. The noisy, noxious vehicles that run on two and three wheels, carrying billions of people daily, are quietly going electric — in turn knocking down oil demand by one million barrels a day this year. | When Nabeela Elsayed was speaking at a corporate conference several years ago and explained that she would miss the group dinner because she was fasting for Ramadan, she recalls, her manager responded: “Just don’t fast.” Ms. Elsayed, an executive coach who was previously chief operating officer for Walmart Canada, said she had heard many such slights when stepping away during the workday to pray. | It was never just about the neon, that Cubist, consumerist razzle-dazzle cantilevered over Hong Kong’s streets announcing pawnbrokers and mooncake bakers, saunas and shark’s fin soup shops. | Our national check-writing habit is turning into an enormous problem. | At the Frick, where Barkley Hendricks’s shimmering ’70s portraits are hanging, posthumously, in the museum’s first solo show by a Black artist, I kept thinking about that Langston Hughes poem: What does happen to a dream deferred? Hendricks didn’t live to see his subjects, with their plentiful Afros and bell-bottom cool, leaping, communing, strolling across the walls of an institution he frequented. But after quietly railing at the omission, I realized the exhibition is actually about Hendricks taking his rightful place — a kind of insistence that a dream, rather than fossilizing, can go on forever. REBECCA THOMAS | For 74 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been America’s most important military alliance. Presidents of both parties have seen NATO as a force multiplier enhancing the influence of the United States by uniting countries on both sides of the Atlantic in a vow to defend one another. | For David Haselgrove, it was a battle each day to get out of bed, then another struggle to put on his socks. Stairs were often impossible, and the pain made him tetchy and difficult to live with. | Criticism of a U.S. veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza grew on Saturday, with rights groups and aid organizations warning that the move would prolong the suffering in the enclave and the leader of the Palestinian Authority issuing a strong condemnation. | On Wednesday night, Sept. 20, 2023, the next day’s newspapers were thundering through the mammoth Goss Colorliner presses at the 13-acre printing plant of The New York Times in College Point, Queens. | If Mayor Eric Adams were in search of evidence that his recent spate of troubles had cost him some standing in New York, he would not need to look far. | On Nov. 17, Silicon Valley tumbled into turmoil when Sam Altman, chief executive of the high-profile A.I. start-up OpenAI, was suddenly removed by the company’s board of directors. After a five-day roller-coaster ride that encapsulated the increasingly heated battle over the future of artificial intelligence, Mr. Altman was reinstated and a new board was created. Here is a list of players in the year’s biggest tech drama: | People have long traveled from all over the world to experience the glitz and bustle of New York City during the holidays. But for three years, that influx of visitors — and their open wallets — has been diminished, thanks to the impact of Covid. | Chrissy West is taking a new approach to her Christmas shopping this year. When buying gifts for her family, she plans to finance them by cashing in her Ulta loyalty points. | Vichet Chum, a Cambodian American playwright, spent much of the fall promoting his debut novel for young adults, “Kween.” That was a horizons-expanding experience for Mr. Chum, 38, who describes his plays as “very adult.” His plays, like the book, are often centered on Khmer identity and queerness. | Around noon on Nov. 17, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, logged into a video call from a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. He was in the city for its inaugural Formula 1 race, which had drawn 315,000 visitors including Rihanna and Kylie Minogue. | What comes to mind when you think of Connecticut? | Hi busy bees! Welcome to today’s Spelling Bee forum. There are a number of terms that appear in both this article and other online discussions of the Spelling Bee; a glossary of those terms compiled by Monicat, a Times reader, can be found below. | Good morning, dear connectors. Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This page contains spoilers for today’s puzzle. Solve Wordle first, or scroll at your own risk. | I started working for the Times’s Australia bureau in 2020, writing stories from my kitchen table — my makeshift office in a locked-down Melbourne. | SmileDirectClub, a telehealth company that sold teeth-straightening devices through the mail and faced criticism from medical groups, said on Friday that it had shut down. | I’m delighted to invite university students to apply for my 2024 win-a-trip contest. I’ve been holding these contests since 2006, and taking the winners along with me on a reporting trip to cover global poverty and social justice issues. My aim is to get more people writing about these neglected topics and to generate more interest in them. | An article on Tuesday about accusations of sexual violence during the Hamas Oct. 7 attacks on Israel misstated the kind of evidence Israeli authorities have gathered in their investigation. The police are relying mainly on witness testimony, not on autopsies or forensic evidence. | “It is practically a miracle that this is even possible.” | In her first campaign stop since Wednesday’s contentious Republican debate, Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador and former governor of South Carolina, largely ignored the many attacks that her fellow candidates, aware of her rise in the polls, had lobbed at her. What she did discuss suggested she continued to feel that the criticism wasn’t, as she said on Wednesday night, “worth my time.” | Just a few months ago, President Biden rarely said the name of his likely opponent in the 2024 presidential election — former President Donald J. Trump — instead invoking other Republicans as proxies during public events or, on occasion, referring simply to “the former guy.” | SATURDAY PUZZLE — Look, we all know it’s Saturday and you’re going have to wrestle with the crossword for a while, but this is definitely a grid you’ll wind up shaking hands with at the end and maybe even taking out for lunch. It’s affable. It’s the first Times collaboration between two constructing veterans, Christina Iverson (now a puzzle editor here) and Doug Peterson (who has made 55 prior puzzles for us). | Ryan O’Neal’s death Friday at the age of 82 followed decades in which the actor was better known for his personal life (and struggles) than for his work. But few stars shone brighter in the 1970s, when O’Neal — originally known for his role on the prime-time soap opera “Peyton Place” — became one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, and proved himself equally adept at drama, comedy and action. Here are a few of his finest films from that period, and where to stream them. | Play a simplified version of the bonus round, then read on for strategy advice, whether you’re a future contestant or just watching at home. | Can you sort 8 historical events? | He had the face of a fairy-tale lead, the kind that would have fit agreeably in an earlier Hollywood era but felt comfortingly alluring in the moment. Ryan O’Neal was a boxer in his youth — announcing his father had died on Friday, his son Patrick O’Neal pointed fans toward YouTube footage of O’Neal fighting Joe Frazier on national TV, with Muhammad Ali doing commentary. But when he migrated to acting, it suited him, and by 1964 he had become a star thanks to the ABC prime-time soap opera “Peyton Place.” | Israeli troops conducted at least one targeted raid in the Gaza Strip on Friday in a failed attempt to rescue hostages held by Hamas, both sides said, making competing claims about deaths and injuries inflicted. | Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of Lower Manhattan on Friday afternoon for what was billed as a “Shut Down Wall Street” event, just as the United States vetoed a resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling for a permanent cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.  | The actor Jonathan Majors implored his former girlfriend not to seek medical help after she sustained a head injury in an unspecified incident in London last year, telling her, “I fear you have no perspective of what could happen if you go to the hospital.”",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York

Oxford University Press, the world’s second-oldest academic press and the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, has rizz. | The main suspect in an assault that left one tourist dead and two other people injured in Paris was known to French intelligence services for Islamist extremism and had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before the attack, the French authorities said on Sunday. | Elections in northern Indian states were seen as a big test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P. Results showed that the party expanded its dominance in a key populous area. | Alaska Airlines said on Sunday that it planned to buy Hawaiian Airlines for $1.9 billion, a deal that would further consolidate the airline industry and probably attract the scrutiny of federal regulators. | Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Sunday that, if elected president, he would pursue legislation that would “supersede” the Affordable Care Act, echoing former President Donald J. Trump’s comments, which Democrats seized upon last week. | Back-to-back storms fueled by atmospheric rivers were expected to move over the northwestern United States this week, bringing heavy rains and snow and raising concerns about flooding, forecasters said. | Isobel Bushell, 19, knew Fortnite’s Big Bang event was going to be popular. The live event, hosted Saturday by Epic Games, promised to introduce new experiences for the beloved battle video game and to feature a musical performance by the rapper Eminem. | A U.S. Navy destroyer shot down three drones during a sustained attack in the Red Sea on Sunday, the Pentagon said, in what could signal another escalation in the tit-for-tat attacks between the American military and Iranian-backed militants. | The U.S. government is making an intense effort to persuade Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations so they can once again pause hostilities and exchange more prisoners for hostages, a White House spokesman said on Sunday. | Geordie Walker, the founding guitarist of the British post-punk band Killing Joke, whose haunting, muscular riffs proved an inspiration to platinum-selling bands including Nirvana and Metallica, died on Nov. 26 in Prague. He was 64. | To the Editor: | Good morning. I can see the scene in my head: yellow leaves skittering down the sidewalk, gathering in piles at the base of stoops as the late-afternoon sun begins its drop. It’s cold, getting colder, and we’re hustling along with a few bottles of wine, a baguette and a bag of slick and salty Marcona almonds to share. | It was still dark on Sunday morning when a man who the authorities said had just killed four family members at their Queens home set the house on fire and slipped out. | Artificial intelligence has been a breakout star in the opening days of COP28, the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Entrepreneurs and researchers have dazzled attendees with predictions that the fast-improving technology could accelerate the world’s efforts to combat climate change and adapt to rising temperatures. | The ruling party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tightened its grip over India’s populous northern belt, results of state elections showed Sunday, expanding its dominance of a key region ahead of general elections in which Mr. Modi is seeking a third term. | This is another end-of-the-year book list, but with a twist. These are the best books I read about 2023. They are, for the most part, voices from other years helping me make sense of our own. In a world where information keeps speeding up and thinning out, books slow time down, thickening the moment in which we live. | For many people, a physically demanding exercise class can be an outlet to relieve the stress of a busy workweek. But what happens when that exercise class is your workweek? | Darlene Williams died in 2020, more than a dozen years after the $8 million sale of a fossilized skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex named Sue that was found on her family’s ranch in South Dakota in 1990. | There is a land mine embedded in the United States Code, one that Donald Trump, if re-elected president, could use to destroy our republic. But it’s not too late for Congress to defuse the mine now and protect America. | When I learned that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor had died, I felt not just the loss of a world historical figure but also the loss of someone who formed a part of my identity. | The truth is plain, but elusive: Beyoncé Knowles-Carter is not only the world’s greatest entertainer, a feminist and a principled advocate of Black culture, but also something of a religious prophet. Her method is admittedly unorthodox and not uncontroversial: She delivers philosophy in Versace, theology in heels on a stage. Each night near the beginning of her performance on her Renaissance tour — and in the eponymous documentary film released on Friday — Beyoncé declared that she wanted the people gathered in her name to find a safe space for liberation. | 1. After looking closely at the image above (or at the full-size image), think about these three questions: | I found myself at the movies this year more often than last. The data suggests that I’m not alone. | While artificial intelligence has taken the limelight over the past year, technology that can appear to operate like human brains has been top of mind for researchers, investors and tech executives in Silicon Valley and beyond for more than a decade. | When Michael Stipe was little, his parents called him Mr. Mouse. He was a scurrier. As soon as he could stand, he ran, and when he ran, he ran until he face-planted. His mother would deposit him in a baby walker, but if Stipe scrambled as fast as he could and hit the threshold of a doorway with a running start, he could topple the walker and eject himself onto the floor. Then he’d spring to his feet and run away.  | For years, professional sports organizations like the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball prohibited liquor companies from buying advertising in locations in stadiums and arenas that could be seen on television, in deference to efforts to curb drunken driving. | Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, finds himself in a political bind. He is under pressure from the United States to hold free and fair elections after years of authoritarian rule or face a reinstatement of crippling economic sanctions. But analysts say he is unlikely to give up power and would most likely lose in a credible election. | When Paul Lynch started writing his novel “Prophet Song,” he worried it might destroy his career. | The six mothers had gathered in a Jerusalem home on a recent Friday to prepare challah, the braided bread that Jews eat on the Sabbath. After they recited a blessing that is part of the ritual, each woman added a prayer of her own. | “One grows so tired, in American public life,” Christian Wiman writes with sudden invigoration, “of the certitudes and platitudes, the megaphone mouths and stadium praise, influencers and effluencers and the whole tsunami of slop that comes pouring into our lives like toxic sludge.” | A few years ago, when he was in his early 30s, Tyler Levy Sniff took a home DNA test he received as a gift. The results revealed a staggering truth: His father wasn’t biologically related to him. Levy Sniff confronted his parents, who explained that after years of trying and failing to have a baby, they turned to a sperm donor. Following the standard advice at the time, they decided not to tell him for fear of driving a wedge into their family. | Once China’s most prolific property developer, China Evergrande may soon be its biggest and messiest corporate breakup. | For years, Purdue Pharma, the maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, had been entangled in lawsuits seeking to hold it to account for its role in the spiraling opioid crisis. | Since fleeing Ukraine with her daughter, Iryna Khomich has made a home of a tiny space in a village of prefabricated units in southwestern Germany. A full tour of its single room takes only a few moments: an iron bunk bed and a wardrobe, shoes scattered near the door, clothes drying on radiators. On one recent afternoon, her cat, Dimka, walked in and out, while her daughter, Sofiia, 8, read a German textbook at a desk. | Nearly two decades after its original run, the beloved American sitcom “Frasier” has been resurrected by Paramount+, and the actor Kelsey Grammer slipped right back into character with all the charm that endeared him to audiences throughout the 1990s. | For me, 2023 was a year of entertainment that captured people pushed to their emotional limits, whether that was the rage of two bitter enemies, the desperation of a widow who only sees a future of annihilation or the pent-up aggression of a bunch of high school girls. But it was also a year of colorful, funny and biting Black stories on stages. Throw in a dancing goth, a freshly single New York City fashionista and a chronicle of a dying band, and you’ve got my top picks for everything that tickled my fancy in the past year across theater, film and TV. | Dr. John Wust does not come off as a labor agitator. A longtime obstetrician-gynecologist from Louisiana with a penchant for bow ties, Dr. Wust spent the first 15 years of his career as a partner in a small business — that is, running his own practice with colleagues. | Gao Zhibin and his daughter left Beijing on Feb. 24 for a better life, a safer one. Over the next 35 days, by airplane, train, boat, bus and foot, they traveled through nine countries. By the time they touched American soil in late March, Mr. Gao had lost 30 pounds. | A best books list is one of my favorite rituals. As the calendar flutters to its final pages, we glance fondly back over the highest peaks climbed in 2023. | In 2014, when the first opioid lawsuits were filed against Purdue Pharma, Tiffinee Scott’s daughter was still years away from her fatal overdose from addictive prescription painkillers, including Purdue’s OxyContin, which she was taking to manage sickle cell pain. | Since I review only nonfiction, I sometimes get tasked with writing about political memoirs — a number of which are geared toward getting you to believe what their politician-authors want you to believe, if not insisting that you should just shut your mind and let them do all the thinking for you. So it was with pleasure and relief that I encountered some philosophically-minded books this year. Amid all the hard sells and hot takes, these books provided some necessary counterprogramming. Their authors are more interested in opening up new ways of understanding than in telling people what to do. | For more than 40 years, Mississippi had one of the strictest school vaccination requirements in the nation, and its high childhood immunization rates have been a source of pride. But in July, the state began excusing children from vaccination if their parents cited religious objections, after a federal judge sided with a “medical freedom” group. | Elon Musk celebrated his 44th birthday in July 2015 at a three-day party thrown by his wife at a California wine country resort dotted with cabins. It was family and friends only, with children racing around the upscale property in Napa Valley. | Gov. Ron DeSantis had just taken office in 2019 when the University of Florida lured Neil H. Buchanan, a prominent economist and tax law scholar, from George Washington University. | In October, the Times journalists Simon Romero and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega were in the Mexican state of Michoacán, traveling across volcanic plateaus that are known for their towering pine and oak forests. | Under an elevated subway track in Queens, Victor José Hernandez was whipping up the pepitos that he had perfected at a street cart in Caracas, Venezuela. | Dear Diary: | Blizzards cause low visibility. And as it turns out, the history of the word “blizzard” is a bit blurry, too. | Good morning, dear connectors. Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Hi busy bees! Welcome to today’s Spelling Bee forum. There are a number of terms that appear in both this article and other online discussions of the Spelling Bee; a glossary of those terms compiled by Monicat, a Times reader, can be found below. | Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This page contains spoilers for today’s puzzle. Solve Wordle first, or scroll at your own risk. | Christmas won’t arrive for three more weeks but “Saturday Night Live” got an early present: When Congress voted on Friday to expel Representative George Santos, it was a bow-tied comedy gift that “S.N.L.” wasted no time unwrapping in this weekend’s broadcast. | The airport in Munich resumed limited operations Sunday morning after being closed for nearly a day because of record snowfall that disrupted transportation across the region. | I was sitting in my apartment in Beirut on the evening of Oct. 13 when I read that journalists had been struck by a missile attack in southern Lebanon. My close friend, Issam Abdallah, was working in the area as a cameraman for Reuters to cover the border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah after the war in Gaza began just days earlier. I called him immediately. It was a ritual we had developed over the years: Whether we were on the front lines in Ukraine or Syria, each of us knew to expect a call from the other anytime a disaster struck. | “I had no role models, and then comes this woman, Sandra Day O’Connor, who says, ‘I can make decisions and I can think independently.’” | An article last weekend in which a writer details his experience arriving in New York City as one of 140,000 Jewish refugees who fled postwar Europe misstated the number of days that asylum seekers must wait before applying for a work permit. It is 150 days, not 180, though a permit will not be granted before 180 days after an asylum seeker has arrived. The article also misidentified the U.S.S. General A.W. Greely. It was a Navy vessel when the author and his family arrived in New York City on March 3, 1950, not a merchant marine vessel. | At least four people were killed and dozens of others injured on Sunday in an explosion at a Roman Catholic Mass inside a university gymnasium in the southern Philippine city of Marawi, officials said. | The super PAC supporting Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in his presidential campaign, which has seen a series of changes in the last month, went through another shake-up this week when it fired its new chief executive officer who had stepped in just nine days earlier, according to two people briefed on the matter. | Former President Donald J. Trump, who has been charged by federal prosecutors with conspiracy to defraud the United States in connection with a plot to overturn the 2020 election, repeatedly claimed to supporters in Iowa on Saturday that it was President Biden who posed a severe threat to American democracy. | Ron DeSantis took the stage in Jasper County in Iowa on Saturday, heralding his appearance as the culmination of his tour of the state’s 99 counties, and hoping to inject enthusiasm into his well-funded but struggling presidential campaign. | The Big 12 Championship game between the Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma State Cowboys on Saturday delivered the kind of controversy-mired barn burner that inspires legions of college football fans to pack stadiums and jam sports bars every weekend. | A German tourist was killed and several other people were injured in central Paris late Saturday after a man attacked them with a knife and a hammer, the French authorities said. The case stirred fears of renewed Islamist terrorist attacks in a nation already on edge.",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The

The original Café Boulud, an Upper East Side neighborhood hangout and destination since 1998, has moved south about half a mile to an area where its customers are likely to be driven more by destination. It’s now installed in a somewhat grander setting near the Plaza Hotel and amid a coterie of other French restaurants. Still, those who know and love the restaurant will recognize the menu; it’s divided in quadrants addressing Le Voyage, La Saisons, Potager and La Tradition, with seasonal updates for each. Right now expect to be tempted by short ribs, crabmeat, mushrooms, sunchokes and desserts sparkling with citrus. The executive chef is Romain Paumier, who worked at the original Café Boulud and was the executive sous chef at Mr. Boulud’s flagship, Daniel. He’s the latest in a kitchen that, over the years, has been an incubator for names like Andrew Carmellini, Gavin Kaysen and Aaron Bludorn. Katalina Diaz, formerly the executive sous chef for pastry at Daniel, is the executive pastry chef. Of all his restaurants, this is the one to which Mr. Boulud is most deeply attached, given that his great-grandparents opened a Café Boulud 100 years ago near Lyon, France, his hometown. The new Café Boulud, designed by Jeffrey Beers, moves into the space that previously housed Vaucluse and before that Park Avenue Cafe, Périgord Park and Voisin. Now with pale gray walls that echo the color of the recently redone Daniel nearby, the new Café Boulud has artwork, traditional detailing, velvet and leather seating in deep teal blue and amber; the space beckons with airy comfort, as yet another reaffirmation that fine dining is sticking around. There are a number of other spaces, including a bar that will open in February, and a series of elegant salons opening in the spring that will be the New York headquarters for Maison Barnes, an international realty company based in Paris, and Mr. Boulud’s new partner.

A jury found that Google violated antitrust laws by maintaining tight control of its app store, harming the Fortnite maker and other developers. | The punch landed only seconds after the referee Halil Umut Meler blew his whistle to end Monday night’s game in Turkey’s top soccer league. The first kick, and then the second, came after that, as the referee lay on the grass, desperately trying to protect his head with both hands. | The Hamas-Israel war has caused so much turmoil on campuses partly because it has highlighted a tension that university administrators haven’t fully acknowledged. | Caity Weaver loves holiday music. She also loves throwing parties. A few years ago, she set a goal: Create the ideal holiday music playlist for the ideal holiday party. Little did she know that it would become an obsession. Throughout the year, she collects new holiday music, and each December finds her spending hours refining her playlist — adding, subtracting and rearranging songs in pursuit of party soundtrack perfection. | Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is making a rare trip to Washington this week, pleading his case for American military aid, something which has long been a lifeline for his country but is now increasingly in doubt. | The New York Times Audio app is home to journalism and storytelling, and provides news, depth and serendipity. If you haven’t already, download it here — available to Times news subscribers on iOS — and sign up for our weekly newsletter. | George Recine, a Boston advertising executive, knew exactly where to eat lunch last week during a business trip to Philadelphia. | When Simon Elkaim hired an architect to redesign his Manhattan apartment, he was clear about his thoughts on color: the bolder and more vibrant, the better. | In the fight to bring down inflation, the falling price of gasoline stands out as a victory, even if Federal Reserve policy has little to do with it. | Fire-engine red, cobalt blue and a futuristic vibe: There’s nothing indistinct or ambiguous about this Manhattan condominium. | Inflation data released on Tuesday showed that price increases remained moderate in November, the latest sign that inflation has cooled substantially from its June 2022 peak. That’s likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to leave interest rates unchanged at its final meeting of the year, which takes place this week. | On Monday, a flawless day for baseball in Los Angeles if it weren’t December, Sean Teng stood in the top deck of Dodger Stadium after a tour and nodded toward the Hollywood sign off in the distance. | It seems obvious to say, but if you want a real sense of the differences between America’s two major parties — and if you want a sense of what the future could bring if either party wins full control of the federal government next year — all you have to do is look at the states. | In Todd Haynes’s newest film, “May December,” Joe Yoo (Charles Melton) is a 30-something man in a marriage with an unconventional back story. He met his wife, Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore), the summer after seventh grade — but she was 36 at the time. She went to prison, but they stayed together, and the two eventually married and had three children. The couple are being shadowed by a famous actress, Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman), who will be portraying Gracie in a movie about the first years of their relationship. As Elizabeth enmeshes herself in their world, Joe opens himself up to her, and one evening, after she invites him to her hotel room, Elizabeth initiates a tentative kiss. “You’re so young,” she says. “Believe me, you could start over.” The two have sex, and we watch Joe thrusting briefly from a bird’s-eye view — a position of surveillance rather than intimacy.  |  | Is vaping a problem in your school or community? What about cigarettes? | Former House Representative Liz Cheney’s recently published book, “Oath and Honor: A Memoir and a Warning,” discusses the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, its aftermath and the repercussions for the United States and democracy. | Here’s a holiday recipe you probably haven’t made. | I live at the base of Basalt Mountain, an ancient volcano that tops out at nearly 11,000 feet in the Roaring Fork Valley of western Colorado. An eruption 10 million years ago contributed to the contours of the landscape. In the mornings I drink strong coffee from a U.S. Forest Service mug, and I look out the window at the light on the peaks, at the wild turkeys pecking in the yard, at the deer so tame that I could touch them. | The first lesbian relationship I saw portrayed on-screen was in “Sailor Moon.” Uranus and Neptune were two characters who seemed undeniably in love. The show is Japanese anime, though, and I could only watch the English-dubbed version that called them “cousins.” The titular Sailor Moon and the other Sailor Scouts are celestial superheroes sent across time to protect Earth from nefarious forces. In the human world, they take on the appearance of ordinary girls, but can transform into their fighting selves via personal totems. Sailor Moon often has a compact mirror and shouts, “Moon Prism Power, Makeup!” before transforming during battle and declaring, “In the name of the moon, I’ll punish you!” Swoon. | It took Anderson Cooper more than a year after his mother’s death to begin clearing out her apartment. It was an emotionally draining task, one that he put off — something his mother may have anticipated, because she left him a road map. | How do you memorialize the people you loved and lost?

But here those secrets, hovering over everything and everyone, may be actual skeletons, and worse. The increasingly unsettling revelations power what The New York Times’s Ben Brantley called a “very fine, subversively original new play” at its Off Broadway premiere in 2014 at the Signature Theater. | On a chilly day in December 2016, Peter Morgan stood on a London street, watching the filming of a scene from his new television series about the British royal family. | Each year as we travel the country to scout out candidates for our many best-restaurant lists — whether the big national listing in the early fall or the new “best of” city lists we’ve begun rolling out — our reporters and editors eat hundreds of meals in dozens of states. Inevitably we come across that one dish that we almost wish we’d ordered two of, and wish we could find closer to home. | Good morning. It’s Tuesday. We’ll find out about your role in choosing the best Metropolitan Diary items of the year. We’ll also get details on the latest milestone in the rollout of recreational marijuana in New York State. | The indictment unsealed in New York on Nov. 29 accusing an unnamed Indian government official of plotting the assassination of a Sikh separatist in America raises many grave questions. Chief among them: Is the partnership between the United States and India in peril? | To write about the poet Anthony Hecht in 2024 is to invite the question of why, in 2024, anyone is writing about the poet Anthony Hecht. His work is so wildly out of step with contemporary practice that it seems almost to come from another, possibly fictional timeline — one in which poets could recite long passages from “Lycidas” from memory and would, of their own free will, be photographed wearing bow ties. | Vincent van Gogh has been surprisingly busy for a dead man. | Last April, Chris Kotchick, a Scranton, Pa., oral surgeon, and his family spent a week on a chartered catamaran in the calm, clear waters off the British Virgin Islands. A crew of two — part of the deal — ran the show. | After Israel’s invasion and thousands of strikes, many neighborhoods lie in ruins. Videos, photos and satellite imagery show how much has been destroyed. | Q: I rarely got pimples when I was a teenager. Now, I get them all the time, and it’s embarrassing. Why am I getting acne as an adult? | We met the ecologist Karen Lips in Washington, D.C. One morning, she picked us up from a Metro station and took us to Shenandoah National Park, keen to show us a species of salamander. | India is known as a country of paradoxes, and a new one has recently emerged. At the same time that the country is poised to become a major global player — with a booming economy and a population that recently surpassed China’s — its democracy is showing signs of decay. | The ecologist Karen Lips observed frogs for several years in Central America. She left briefly, and when she returned, the frogs were gone. She sets out to find them and encounters a horrible truth. | Fans of the K-pop band BTS have known for years that a day would come when its seven members would all be doing mandatory service in the South Korean military. | Shakima Tozay was 37 years old and six months pregnant when a nurse, checking the fetal heart rate of the baby boy she was carrying, referred to him as “a hoodlum.” | Taslima Amjad has called, emailed or visited government offices in New York City nearly every day for months, in search of help for her 3-year-old nonverbal son. | New York State is planning to pay landlords who rent out single room occupancy units, commonly known as S.R.O.s, in an attempt to fight homelessness by slowing the decades-long decline in the number of small, cheap rental homes. | This weekend, the baseball player Shohei Ohtani announced that he had agreed to a record 10-year, $700 million contract to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

In a show of solidarity with Hamas, Hezbollah has launched repeated missile and drone attacks on army bases and other targets inside Israel, forcing the evacuation of civilians and prompting cross-border strikes. | China’s leader, Xi Jinping, arrived in Vietnam on Tuesday for a relatively rare trip abroad, seeking to elevate ties with an important neighbor just three months after President Biden visited Hanoi on a similar mission. | French, by most estimates the world’s fifth most spoken language, is changing — perhaps not in the gilded hallways of the institution in Paris that publishes its official dictionary, but on a rooftop in Abidjan, the largest city in Ivory Coast. | A bright orange robot, 10 feet tall, looms over Volkswagen’s new electric car assembly line in central China. It was imported from Germany. The factory’s other 1,074 robots were made in Shanghai. | The WhatsApp group members had advantages many fellow Gazans lacked: working cellphones and a way to communicate with one another to avoid deadly Israeli strikes. | “Transforming Spaces” is a series about women driving change in sometimes unexpected places. | In November 2022, Li Ying was a painter and art school graduate in Milan, living in a state of sadness, fear and despair.

It was the trial by Bluebird Bio, not Vertex Pharmaceuticals. | “You are vibrating the brain, the nerves, the connections. Any of those connections get screwed up, you got problems.” | Sharon Alony-Cunio and her twin 3-year-old daughters survived 52 days in Hamas captivity. Her husband is still being held in Gaza. | Jump to: Today’s Theme | Tricky Clues | A federal judge in Texas on Monday upheld a ban that prevented state employees from using TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, on government devices and networks, rejecting a challenge by lawyers who argued that the prohibition had violated the First Amendment. | A commercial ship was hit and set on fire by an anti-ship cruise missile in the southern Red Sea, an attack U.S. officials say came from the Iranian-backed Houthi militia in Yemen. | President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine began his last-ditch pitch for additional U.S. aid for his country’s war effort after arriving in Washington on Monday by declaring that the true winner of the stalled negotiations in Congress is Russia. | Hasbro, the toymaker behind popular brands like Peppa Pig, Transformers and Magic: The Gathering, said on Monday that it would eliminate roughly 1,110 jobs, or nearly 17 percent of its work force, as the company continued to grapple with weak sales. | Street-to-street combat raged in what Israel described as three Hamas strongholds in the Gaza Strip on Monday, as top Israeli officials warned that increased attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah, from Lebanon, could prompt a powerful response. | A drunken philosopher alights on what may be his pinnacle argument: That we are shaped not by the facts of history, but by our imagination of it. “We must never cease renewing those images,” he says, or we’ll stop living. | A jury ruled on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws to extract fees and limit competition from Epic Games and other developers on its Play mobile app store, in a case that could rewrite the rules on how thousands of businesses make money on Google’s smartphone operating system, Android. | This essay has been updated to reflect news developments. | Have you heard that there’s a huge wave of organized shoplifting — coordinated theft by groups effectively looting stores — sweeping the United States? You probably have. A couple of years ago, Walgreens said that organized shoplifting was behind its decision to close several locations in San Francisco. In April, the National Retail Federation issued a dire report claiming that “organized retail crime” was responsible for almost half of the store merchandise that vanished in 2021. The putative shoplifting tsunami has been relentlessly hyped both by the usual suspects, such as Fox News, and by some politicians.",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The

Now open at the Public Theater, just a few subway stops away from Wall Street, Nagle’s play traces the origins of American finance and the follies of its bottomless appetite for capital to the exploitation of the Lenape by the city’s Dutch settlers. | The Israeli military has released a photo of 11 senior Hamas military leaders gathered in a tunnel beneath Gaza and said that five of them had been killed. | It's been more than 50 years since NASA astronauts walked on the moon, and a new report suggests they'll need to wait even longer. | John Kerry, President Biden’s special envoy for climate change, said on Wednesday that the United States supported a phaseout of fossil fuels, his clearest statement yet on America’s position on one of the most intractable issues under debate at the United Nations climate talks in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. | Update, Dec. 8, 2023: Harve Pierre, a co-defendant in the suit, released a statement denying the allegations. This article has been updated to include Mr. Pierre’s comments. | To the Editor: | The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it had charged four Russian soldiers with torturing an American living in the war-ravaged region of Kherson in Ukraine, using a war crimes statute for the first time since it was enacted nearly three decades ago. | The European Union plans to postpone strict local-content rules that would have led to costly tariffs imposed on cars traded between the bloc and Britain beginning Jan. 1. | President Biden called on congressional Republicans on Wednesday to put aside “petty, partisan, angry politics” and pass a multibillion-dollar aid package for Ukraine, warning that failure to do so could enable President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to reclaim momentum in the war and even draw in American troops. | Samir Shah, a longtime TV executive, was selected to be the next chairman of the BBC, Britain’s public broadcasting company, the government said on Wednesday, about eight months after a political scandal led to the resignation of the previous chairman, Richard Sharp. Mr. Shah’s appointment is subject to questioning by lawmakers. | My mother, who is in her early 70s and was widowed about a year ago, has been struggling to adjust to life without her husband. As her only child, I have also been struggling to find ways to be helpful. Finances have been a particular challenge for her; one concern is the cost of her cable and streaming subscriptions.  | Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, who made history as the first speaker to be ousted from the post, announced on Wednesday that he would leave the House at the end of the year but said he planned to remain engaged in Republican politics. | This year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first two vaccines that can protect older adults from respiratory syncytial virus, which leads to at least 6,000 deaths and 60,000 hospitalizations among adults 65 and older each year. | Nguyen Qui Duc, the proprietor of a salon and exhibition space that became a Hanoi landmark, where both Vietnamese and foreigners gathered for music, poetry and long nights of drinks and sushi, died on Nov. 22 in a hospital in Hanoi. He was 65. | As an unidentified canine respiratory illness continues to pop up in clusters around the United States — causing symptoms like cough, fever and lethargy, and in more serious cases, hospitalization or death — many dog owners are wondering what steps they should take to keep their pets safe. | The Killers released “Mr. Brightside” 20 years ago and hardly anybody cared. | Laura Read, a former beauty influencer from London, didn’t understand why her skin was breaking out. She regularly collaborated with cosmetics companies for her YouTube tutorials and had her pick of lotions, potions and creams to address the issues. But none of them seemed to help. Ms. Read said she struggled with “a bumpy forehead, milia around my eyes and eczema on my cheeks” for years. | Every latke lover has an ideal. For some that perfect latke is chubby and soft-centered, with fine shreds of potatoes that melt in your mouth. For others it’s thin and golden, and shatters with an audible crunch. | A Barbie doll in the likeness of Wilma Mankiller, the first woman to be elected chief of the Cherokee Nation, has been hailed by tribal citizens. It’s also been lamented for its inaccuracies. | The news broke early one July morning: Rex Heuermann, a 59-year-old architect on Long Island, had been arrested in three of the notorious Gilgo Beach serial killings. Within minutes of hearing the news, I was driving from my apartment in Manhattan to his home in Massapequa Park. | New York State has leaped into the era of offshore wind power, with electricity generated over the Atlantic Ocean now flowing to homes on Long Island. | One of the most delightful decisions I made this year was to declare a “summer of snob.” For a few gloriously hot and sunny months, my fiction (and sometimes nonfiction) reading was loosely organized around the theme of snobbery. Loopy heiresses, high-society murders and class anxiety galore populated my reading list, giving just enough of a thematic through line to provide interesting comparisons without becoming repetitive or boring. | Not long after completing “The Dinner Party” (1974-79), her monumental installation dedicated to historical women, the artist Judy Chicago began researching depictions of birth in Western art — only to discover there were almost none. “If men had babies, there would be thousands of images of the crowning,” she said. In an effort to fill this void, she went straight to the source. She witnessed a live birth — the San Francisco-based designer Karin Hibma agreed to let Chicago sketch in the delivery room — and sent detailed questionnaires to more than 100 mothers. (Sample questions: Why did you want to have a baby? What physical changes have become permanent?) Part of her resulting work, “The Birth Project” series (1980-85), made up of painted, woven and embroidered images of women in labor, is currently on view at Chicago’s retrospective at the New Museum in New York. Many of the images are epic in tone and size: Breasts become mountains and rivers flow from between open legs. Chicago was, as she later wrote, “building a form language almost ‘from scratch,’” one that linked the act of birth to divine creation. But to this day, according to Massimiliano Gioni, one of the show’s curators, the series has never been shown in full. | His plane flanked by four fighter jets, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia began a rare trip on Wednesday to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two oil-rich Gulf nations that have resisted pressure to take sides in the Ukraine war. | In the cold winter of 1972, a schoolteacher in a poor Chinese village asked his whole class: “The U.S. president, Nixon, and his adviser Dr. Kissinger will be in China. What should we do?” | This article is part of a series called Turning Points, in which writers explore what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. You can read more by visiting the Turning Points series page. | For more than a year, Google has raced to build technology that could match ChatGPT, the eye-opening chatbot offered by the San Francisco artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI. | At a police training seminar in Atlantic City, N.J., one instructor flashed a photo of a monkey while telling participants about his interaction with a 75-year-old Black man, video shows. Another appeared to mock the L.G.B.T.Q. community: “He or she, him, her, she, him” — whatever “you want to call people now.” Several instructors referred to the size of their genitals in lectures that glorified violence. | An article on Tuesday about Russian prisoners who enlisted to fight in the war in Ukraine misidentified one of the IK6 recruits. His name is Vitali, not Aleksandr. | In 1942, Norman Lear signed up to fight the fascists. He served as a radio operator and gunner in a B-17 bomber named “Umbriago” by its crew, after a catchphrase of the comedian Jimmy Durante. As Lear watched bombs spill out of the plane’s belly over Germany, he said in a 2021 interview with the Yiddish Book Center, his attitude was “Screw ’em.” But there was also a complicating empathy: “I remember thinking, imagining a table of family, of Germans, sitting around the table as the bombs dropped.” | The writer and producer Norman Lear, who died on Tuesday at 101, got his start in television in the 1950s, selling jokes and sketches to comedians like Jerry Lewis. After dabbling in film as a screenwriter and a director, Lear — already approaching his 50s — found unlikely success and a new career path when he convinced CBS to take a chance on his sitcom “All in the Family” in 1971. Though the show was based on the British series “Till Death Us Do Part,” Lear made his version distinctly American and of the moment, bringing spirited arguments about race, class, religion, politics and the generation gap into living rooms across the country. | Earlier this year, The New York Times released its choices for the 25 best restaurants in Los Angeles and San Francisco. | I am the youngest of four siblings. I live closest to our widowed mother, who is 84 and homebound. My siblings live out of state, so it has fallen to me to manage her deteriorating health and cognition for the past decade: visiting, paying bills, grocery shopping, going to doctor’s appointments, managing medications, hiring caregivers — and more. I am exhausted! While my siblings seem grateful that I’ve got our mother covered, there is little communication with me or compassion for the time I devote to our mother’s growing needs. I wish I could teach them to care more. I hear from them rarely — every few months from one, once a year from another and not at all from the third — and, sadder, neither does my mother. Is it possible to motivate slacker siblings? | Norman Lear, the television writer and producer who introduced political and social commentary into situation comedy with “All in the Family” and other shows, proving that it was possible to be topical as well as funny while attracting millions of viewers, died on Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 101. | As the four remaining prominent Republican presidential contenders not named Donald Trump assemble for the latest G.O.P. primary debate tonight, just one will arrive with any sort of positive momentum. | Last week, the actress Felicity Huffman made her first public comments about her role in the Varsity Blues admissions scandal, in which several wealthy parents paid a corrupt private admissions consultant named Rick Singer thousands of dollars to help them cheat to get their children into elite colleges. In 2019, Huffman pleaded guilty to “a single count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, acknowledging that she paid $15,000 to arrange for cheating on her daughter’s SAT test.” She spent 11 days in prison, paid a $30,000 fine and had to do community service as part of her sentence. | Time magazine on Wednesday named Taylor Swift as its person of the year.  | As Ukraine steps up efforts to press for more military support for its conflict with Russia, political frictions have emerged at a critical moment for the country. | British American Tobacco, the cigarette giant whose portfolio includes Camel and Lucky Strike, said Wednesday that it would write down the value of its brands by 25 billion pounds, or $31.5 billion, because of the slowing economy and a shift toward vaping among smokers. | This year has been a good one for labor unions. They have won victories in Hollywood and the auto industry, and 67 percent of Americans approve of unions, according to Gallup. Still, I remain skeptical that union organizing is on the cusp of a major turnaround, unless federal law changes. For now, companies that aren’t unionized have many ways to prevent a union from forming even when most workers want to join one. | The New York Times Audio app is home to journalism and storytelling, and provides news, depth and serendipity. If you haven’t already, download it here — available to Times news subscribers on iOS — and sign up for our weekly newsletter. | The opioid epidemic has been one of the biggest public health disasters in generations. The drug company at the heart of the crisis, Purdue Pharma, maker of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, agreed to a multibillion-dollar deal to settle thousands of claims against it — but that agreement would also grant the family behind the company, the Sacklers, immunity from additional civil lawsuits. | Herbie Hancock has spent the better part of his more than 60-year career composing and performing jazz that has won awards and defied categorization. The music writer Marcus J. Moore pinpoints pivotal moments in Hancock’s discography that inspire joy and admiration. | The predictive power of horse-race polling a year from the presidential election is weak at best. The Biden campaign can take some comfort in that. But what recent surveys do reveal is that the coalition that put Joe Biden in the White House in the first place is nowhere near as strong as it was four years ago. | Some public school educators in Oakland, Calif., presented pro-Palestinian lessons on Wednesday as part of an unauthorized teach-in. | The film “Leave the World Behind” centers on the idea of mistrust and how easy it is for humans to lose empathy for one another when faced with a crisis. It is at once unnerving, misanthropic and bleak, and, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, it’s produced by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, Higher Ground. | Follow live updates on the fourth Republican presidential debate. | Do you have new teachers every school year? | Zoe Fishman couldn’t stop thinking about the man she called her “subway crush.” For years, she saw Ronen on the train and admired him from afar. | Good morning. It’s Wednesday. We’ll meet someone who can laugh at Dracula because he’s like family. We’ll also find out why grade inflation has become an issue at Yale University. | With its wooded hills, winding roads and shimmering lakes and reservoirs, Ringwood, N.J., feels more like the Catskills than like a New Jersey suburb. That rural charm was what attracted Linda and James Pentifallo when they decided to leave their longtime home in River Edge, in Bergen County. | Residents say this northern Passaic County borough resembles the Catskills: “You’re in the country, and yet you’re not far from the city.” | In 1950, when Grand Teton National Park was expanded eastward across Jackson Hole, Wyo., its new boundaries nearly subsumed a square mile of state land. Like the national park, forest and elk reserve surrounding it, this is no ordinary piece of ground. | Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate, held in Tuscaloosa, Ala., will feature just four candidates — Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and Chris Christie — sparring over everything from abortion to Israel to former President Donald Trump. When we asked Times Opinion columnists and contributors what they would ask the candidates if they were moderating the debate, they came back to us with questions designed to test them on guns and crime, foreign wars and health care — exposing where the field stands on, say, military aid for Ukraine or a draconian state abortion ban. But above all, what they wanted to see was the moderators needling the candidates into taking a strong stance on the former president. Here are the responses: | “Somehow dissolves have entered the unfortunate club with voice-over and zooms — things in film you’re not supposed to use,” the filmmaker Alexander Payne has contended. “And I don’t know why.” He was reflecting on films like “The Last Detail,” a 1973 movie directed by Hal Ashby, whom Payne regards as “a master of doing very long and beautiful dissolves — very emotional dissolves.” Already, by 1973, the use of dissolves in film editing had begun to ebb. But this has not stopped Payne from pursuing a career-long study of the technique that extends into his affecting new film, “The Holdovers.” | World leaders at the annual United Nations climate talks have battled for years over whether they should “phase out” fossil fuels like coal or just phase them “down.” | There’s been a bombardment of bad news for drug supplies. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists found this summer that nearly all of the members it surveyed were experiencing drug shortages, which generally affect half a million Americans. Cancer patients have scrambled as supplies of chemotherapy drugs dwindle. Other shortages include antibiotics for treatable diseases, such as the only drug recommended for use during pregnancy to prevent congenital syphilis (a disease that is 11 times more common today than a decade ago), and A.D.H.D. medications, without which people struggle to function in their day-to-day lives. The toll on Americans is heavy. | The album may be imperiled; people have been saying so for decades, even though the form has resisted extinction. Meanwhile, songs flourish, whether or not they’re destined for albums, and are ever more flexible. Some maintain the pop conventions of verse-chorus-verse; others distill themselves down to TikTok-ready hooks or sprawl across digital time frames. Here are 30 of my favorite songs from 2023 — less a ranking than a playlist, a tribute to creative abundance. | “In a time of great shift we must respond in kind,” the writer and editor Meaghan O’Connell recently wrote on X. “The media industry needs a new genre: gift guide criticism.” | This house is part of a small community of homes with easy access to Mamanasco Lake, where popular activities include kayaking, swimming and bird-watching. It is about a 10-minute drive from small shops and restaurants, a theater and a post office in the center of town. | “Have you seen the sausage ad?” Andrew Scott asked me. | In early March 2020, the composer Jay Schwartz traveled to San Diego from his home in Cologne, Germany, to attend the funeral for Don Bukovich — his stepfather and the only person in his extended family with an affinity for classical music. | The drive from Nashville to New Orleans is 533 miles. | The couple couldn’t quite remember when the 61-year-old man started to get sick. Was it before he retired the previous spring? No — it was later, the man insisted. But both men agreed that they knew something was seriously wrong the day the recent retiree fell going up the stairs. He was carrying his new laptop when his right leg suddenly buckled. If he hadn’t had the computer, he might have been able to catch himself. Instead, holding his new machine aloft, he fell forward and slid down a couple of steps. He scraped his shins and forearms; blood seeped from the shallow wounds. And he was too weak to get up. “I need help,” he called to his partner upstairs. The man, already on his feet after hearing the thump, appeared almost instantly at his side.  | As the afternoon light softened, a man holding a megaphone stepped to the front of a crowd of about 200 people in the Bahraini capital, Manama, and began to shout at the top of his lungs. | The fall season has felt like a year — New York City Ballet kicked off its 75th anniversary celebrations and Dance Reflections, a festival sponsored by Van Cleef & Arpels, landed in New York. Fall also saw the opening of Intima, a new arts space in Ridgewood, Queens. When I couldn’t fit shows into my schedule, I settled for dress rehearsals, including “No Furniture: Suite for a Loft Apartment,” by Lavinia Eloise Bruce. Formal and ferocious and held in a secret location — a South Street Seaport loft — “No Furniture” deserves another run. | As the world grows increasingly fractured, taking the time to engage with strangers has become even more important. The artist and graphic journalist Wendy MacNaughton has created a simple but powerful way for people to connect in an isolated world. | There were a ton of amazing horror books published in 2023, and as a genre, horror delivered so much — from fresh takes on vampire stories to historical works that looked at racism and misogyny. That made selecting just 10 titles for this list a formidable task. So consider this a personal pantheon of favorites from 2023. | Moira is a teenager on the run when she steps further back into the many layers of grand landscape paintings that make up the mountains, valleys and rivers of A Highland Song. She crosses the video game’s Scottish Highlands on her journey to the coast in time for the Gaelic May Day festival Beltane, where her uncle, a lighthouse keeper, is waiting. | Last year, it became Humberto Leon’s job to shape the appearances of 20 young women, whose ages ranged from 14 to 21. | To reach the top of the Waldspritz sledding run above the village of Grindelwald in the Swiss Alps, I hiked 90 minutes into the backcountry, dragging a small runnered sled by a rope to roughly 7,400 feet. | We’ve taken you through the great jazz pianists, the vocalists, the careers of Alice Coltrane and Ornette Coleman and Mary Lou Williams. This month, we thought we’d go down a less-trodden path, taking a look at one of the more overlooked instruments in jazz: the flute. | Despite the La Niña weather pattern that dumped snowfall by the foot last winter at many mountain resorts in the western United States, global warming fundamentally threatens the survival of the ski business. In response, ski areas are increasingly investing in efficient snow-making and carbon emissions reductions. Some areas, especially in the West, are also pursuing another method: developing terrain higher up mountains where colder climes or steeper, tree-filled terrain are more likely to hold the snow. | After months of public deliberation and prodding from donors aligned with Israel, George Latimer, the Westchester County executive, said on Wednesday that he would mount a Democratic primary challenge against Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York. | Few challenges are as complex in Madrid as finding a cat. Not the animal, but a gato — someone who was born in Madrid, whose parents and grandparents were born in Madrid. Nobody in Madrid was born here: You’ll seldom be asked where you are from, because the assumption is that you’re from somewhere else, although suspicion — and prejudice — can come up when you have a certain accent or skin color. | The authorities in Texas said on Wednesday that a former U.S. Army officer with a history of mental health issues killed his parents in the family’s San Antonio-area home before traveling about 80 miles to Austin, where he fatally shot four more people on Tuesday. | Some people love Disney — its characters and movies — so much that they want to live in its fantasy world every day at home. | The “people” on this list — who are presented in no particular order — reflect the ways that the Styles desk defines its coverage: high and low; fun and serious; curious and open-minded; reveling in characters; appreciating the material world; inviting everyone to the party. | Eight years ago, Megyn Kelly’s turn as a debate moderator made headlines around the world. Before an audience of 24 million Fox News viewers, she confronted Donald J. Trump about his history of misogynist remarks, setting off a well-publicized feud that helped her leap from cable news to NBC. | Three years after Bayer agreed to pay $10 billion to settle claims that its weedkiller, Roundup, caused cancer, juries continue to award plaintiffs in additional cases billions of dollars in damages, even as the German drug and chemicals giant insists it will continue its fight in court. | Hi busy bees! Welcome to today’s Spelling Bee forum. There are a number of terms that appear in both this article and other online discussions of the Spelling Bee; a glossary of those terms compiled by Monicat, a Times reader, can be found below. | Good morning, dear connectors. Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This page contains spoilers for today’s puzzle.

After the horrors of the Holocaust and the difficulties of reunification, the country acquired a reputation as a leader of the free world. Economically prosperous, politically stable and more welcoming to immigrants than most other countries, the Germans — many thought — had really learned their lesson. | The U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps said on Wednesday that they were grounding their fleets of Ospreys after a preliminary investigation found that a problem with the aircraft may have caused a crash last week off Japan that is believed to have killed all eight airmen aboard. | President Biden condemned the “unimaginable cruelty” of Hamas attackers who raped and mutilated women in Israel on Oct. 7, and he blamed the terrorist group’s refusal to release its remaining female hostages for the breakdown in cease-fire talks. Hamas has rejected the allegations. Read an analysis of Biden’s foreign policy strategy. | Regretful but unruffled, Boris Johnson acknowledged on Wednesday that as Britain’s prime minister during the pandemic, he had underestimated the emerging threat of the coronavirus in early 2020. But he rejected suggestions that his government’s initially sluggish response had driven up Britain’s death toll. | When European Union leaders introduced a 125-page draft law to regulate artificial intelligence in April 2021, they hailed it as a global model for handling the technology. | Actors have voted to approve a new three-year contract with studios although some union members remained dissatisfied with the deal’s artificial intelligence protections. The ratification formally ended six months of labor unrest in the entertainment industry. | Twice during a town hall on “Fox News” on Tuesday night, Sean Hannity asked former President Donald J. Trump to say categorically that he would not abuse presidential power and retaliate against his political opponents if elected next year. | One of the strengths of “Fargo” this season is the way it has drawn closer to the Coensverse by re-contextualizing major pieces of it, rather than by tucking in referential Easter eggs for fans to collect. (Although it has done plenty of that, too.) The first attempt to abduct Dot, for example, closely mirrors the sequence in the Coens’ “Fargo” where Jean Lundegaard has her morning routine disrupted by intruders, though Dot proves far more capable of defending herself. She is determined, beyond all reason, to be like Jean, the housewife and P.T.A. mom who carves out a little time to knit in front of weekday talk shows. But she cannot escape who she really is. | A 42-year-old woman was fatally shot in east London on Tuesday evening in a rare deadly shooting, the authorities said. | Darryl George, the Texas high school student who earlier this year was removed from school because his hairstyle violated a dress code, was suspended again on Tuesday, the latest flashpoint in a monthslong dispute over a school policy that has spilled into the courts. | Jump to: Today’s Theme | Tricky Clues | A confidant of Donald J. Trump who is likely to serve in a senior national security role in any new Trump administration threatened on Tuesday to target journalists for prosecution if the former president regains the White House. | Peru’s top court on Tuesday ordered former President Alberto Fujimori released from prison, where he is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations, defying an order by an international court that the South American country keep him behind bars. | Israeli soldiers pushed into the heart of the largest city in the southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, Israel and Hamas said, amid some of the most intense bombing and ground combat of the war, and growing concerns that there is almost nowhere left for desperate civilians to flee.",The New York Times | The New York Times |

A digital print on a mirror made by the artist Sylvie Fleury, the woman was permanently frozen in the act, her bare midriff impervious to the rain outside. A collection of real bags on the floor before her doubled the optical illusion for passers-by, who might have been carrying their own bags from the nearby Versace or Dolce & Gabbana stores. But the gallery, Sprüth Magers, is not the kind of place where most people can casually drop in and buy something; the artworks sold there fetch prices in the tens to the hundreds of thousands. If Fleury’s work poked fun at the view that art is just a commodity, it was also a nostalgic reflection on the moment the empty shopping bags were first shown by the gallery, in 1991 — a time when neither she nor her dealers could have afforded a permanent storefront in Mayfair. | The Texas Supreme Court on Monday overturned a lower court order allowing an abortion for a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, hours after her lawyers said she had decided to leave Texas for the procedure in the face of the state’s abortion bans. | The world’s central banks are moving briskly, and it would seem inexorably, toward introducing digital forms of cash.

The film is set at a modest château in the Loire region, the centerpiece of which is the robust kitchen where Dodin-Bouffant and his cook, Eugénie, prepare sumptuous meal after meal for Dodin’s small coterie of gourmands, as their own love story gently simmers. The pièce de résistance is a classic pot-au-feu. The chef Pierre Gagnaire was the consultant for the cooking, and in an interview in New York he said “everything is real; there was no faking.” (Not quite: There was backup gas fuel for the wood-burning stove, and small quail stood in for ortolans, a delicacy that is illegal.) He said the stars knew how to cook and “jumped right in.” Ms. Binoche told me that the food “haute cuisine but not pretentious.”  From Dec. 13 through 20, there will be a menu at Frenchette, in TriBeCa, with three dishes from “The Taste of Things”: a ballotine of duck, pot-au-feu and baked Alaska ($90 or à la carte).  | Before the arrival of Nicki Minaj in the late 2000s, only a handful of female rappers had ever released platinum solo albums: Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, Lil’ Kim, Foxy Brown, Da Brat, Eve.

Framed from behind, Molly (Molly Reisman), a 20-something woman in Toronto, and her new housemate, wait in a car by the side of the road as a cop issues Molly a ticket for reckless driving.

The incident takes over Molly’s entire life as she becomes increasingly obsessed with fighting the ticket — re-enacting the scenario repeatedly, doing the rounds of traffic court and talking her friends’ and co-workers’ ears off about the wrongs of the system. | In 2015, the first year Héctor Arguinzones celebrated Christmas in the United States, he longed to share his mother’s hallacas with his wife, Niurka Meléndez, and their son, Samuel. | My mind has been restless this week. Though I’ve never been a morning person, I’ve been waking at 5 a.m., thoughts churning in my head like flotsam.

Wearing brown boots without laces and draped in fabric, he makes his way across the space when a bulky mound of material slips down his back. With a restless squirm, he shakes it until potatoes rain onto the floor like hail, adding more objects to the theatrical canvas. He rips the burlap sack off his back and whips it into the air, sending it offstage with a flourish. | The Belgian national railway company earned the equivalent of millions of dollars for deporting nearly 25,000 Jews and Roma, as well as forced laborers and members of the resistance, to Nazi concentration camps during World War II, a report has found. | The Times’s Ken Bensinger has been tracking a group of mostly anonymous video producers who are flooding social media with memes riddled with sexist and racist tropes. | Former Gov.

Kevin and Casey discuss how the ruling could reshape the digital economy. Then, a growing movement of developers and enthusiasts of artificial intelligence want the technology developed as quickly as possible, even if it has negative consequences for humanity. And, finally, why the internet of the future could look totally different. | By the time the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, a draft of the ruling had been leaked to the press and the outcome was anticipated. The story behind the decision seemed obvious: The constitutional right to abortion effectively had died with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose replacement, Amy Coney Barrett, was a favorite of the anti-abortion movement. | The easy and obvious way to understand the various Republican power grabs underway in states across the country is to look at them as attempts to secure as much unaccountable political power as possible and to curtail the expression of identities and beliefs Republicans find objectionable. That’s how we get the “Don’t Say Gay” laws and attacks on gender-affirming care and aggressive efforts to gerrymander entire state legislatures. | In a new essay in the progressive magazine In These Times, the writers Kathryn Joyce and Jeff Sharlet grapple with the contemporary version of an old phenomenon: erstwhile leftists decamping to the right.

Kennedy Jr., and the journalist Matt Taibbi, a onetime scourge of Wall Street, who was recently one of the winners of a $100,000 prize from the ultraconservative Young America’s Foundation. | My mother recently spent a week in a hospital near my house, after experiencing complications from an ongoing illness. Thankfully, I could visit her every day. | A selection of entertainment highlights this weekend, including “Wonka,” starring Timothée Chalamet. | Including titles by Stacy Schiff, Paul Harding, Len Deighton and more.  | Environmental disaster and artificial intelligence run amok have emerged as the major science-fiction concerns of our time. Compared to those, gray, almond-eyed aliens in flying saucers, hellbent on destroying humanity, feel like a throwback to simpler times. But “No One Will Save You,” Brian Duffield’s genre exercise, is deceptive. | The final line of this week’s episode of “The Curse” finds Asher saying, “I’m fine, don’t worry about me.” But I am starting to worry about him. It’s not quite sympathy — Asher hasn’t done enough to deserve that. Maybe it’s something more akin to concern. After all, as he says it, his left hand is dripping with blood. It’s his own fault. He filled his palm with nails to test whether Nala has some sort of psychic powers. This is a sign of a man losing his grip with reality. | Last Thursday, the first night of Hanukkah, Etan Rosenbloom, 41, went to his office holiday party at Cara Restaurant, an airy, farm-to-table spot in Los Angeles. | Tim Peterson, a bald and burly Air Force veteran running for Congress in Minnesota’s Fifth District, wants to discuss the “existential” problem that Minneapolis faces with mass retirements of police officers looming on the horizon. But he has to state something else first: Hamas is fascist. | Which activities do you look forward to during the holiday season? Putting up decorations? Watching movies? Building gingerbread houses? | For years, entertainment company executives happily licensed classic movies and television shows to Netflix. Both sides enjoyed the spoils: Netflix received popular content like “Friends” and Disney’s “Moana,” which satisfied its ever-growing subscriber base, and it sent bags of cash back to the companies. | The panic among faculty at the University of Florida began this month once word started to spread: Do not make offers yet to graduate students from seven “countries of concern.” | A soft voice broke into the dark auditorium, lit only by a projection of a globe bearing the outline of Africa on a screen. | A few years before she left the Supreme Court in 2006, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor explained the relationship between courts and the public.

But during a camping trip there in early 2020, he discovered the wooded plot wasn’t as lonely as he thought. That evening, a ruffed grouse — a crow-size bird with a tiny mohawk and mottled feathers — appeared at his feet. | Free speech is very hard to get right, especially on campus — as has been evident all fall at the University of Pennsylvania, where I teach a course on the history of free speech and censorship. If colleges and universities are best understood as microcosms of the larger world, they should be governed by the First Amendment alone. This would mean restricting only speech that directly incites violence, threatens specific individuals or constitutes targeted harassment. | It is time. | One by one, the American soldiers slid down a muddy hillside to a river deep in the Hawaiian jungle. With guns on top of rucksacks, they kicked their way across, wobbling in the current, trying to stay quiet. | On the day that Queen Elizabeth II died, Lesley Manville was in hospital. | In Netflix’s new animated miniseries “Carol & the End of the World,” the question is not whether the apocalypse can be averted. The rogue planet that is definitely going to collide with Earth in about seven months is steadily growing larger in the sky. Humanity has accepted its fate; heroics are of no use. With the time they have left, people are out partying, traveling and hang-gliding, all of which are now clothing optional. | Good morning. It’s Friday. In the wake of a building collapse in the Bronx, we’ll look at inspections that every building in New York City is supposed to undergo. We’ll also find out who will be the Republican nominee for the House seat vacated by George Santos. | Have we reached peak Taylor Swift?

She was thrilled. | Before he read “Erasure,” Percival Everett’s satirical novel about Black representation in the publishing industry, Cord Jefferson had never really thought of himself as a movie director. He had hoped to direct for television — his writing credits include several episodes of “Master of None,” “The Good Place” and HBO’s “Watchmen,” for which he shared an Emmy in 2020 — but even that seemed like a stretch. | From his tiny gem store in southern New Mexico, Robert Hanseck spends his days untangling chakra beads and answering questions about the healing properties of amethyst crystals. After four decades behind the register, he has met thousands of wellness-minded tourists eager to explore the hot springs that span the region. | These days, the background music of my life is a chorus of coughing and sneezing.

At home, my daughter returns from day care with a backpack full of construction paper crafts and, more often than not, a runny nose. | Two weeks ago, Zvika Arran reluctantly drew a gun at an Israeli state-run shooting class for those seeking firearms licenses, part of a massive spike in applications since the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7. | About 10 years ago, when I was living in Mexico, I went to a party at a beach house that belonged to a friend. It was an overcast afternoon on the Pacific Coast, but there’s a certain moment at the end of the day when the sun dips under the clouds and floods everything in light. It was then that we all saw what wasn’t visible before: a mansion, in the distance across the bay, sitting alone on its own beach, with a blue dome and fiery orange walls suddenly glowing in the dark forest that surrounded it. Someone said it had been built by the billionaire corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith in 1989. There were zebras and African antelope on the grounds; Ronald Reagan and Henry Kissinger had both been guests. | Dr. Mandy K. Cohen dropped by the Fox affiliate in Dallas in November, just days after the governor of Texas signed a law barring private employers from requiring Covid-19 shots. If she thought promoting vaccination would be a tough sell in a ruby-red state, Dr. Cohen, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did not give any indication. | What do we do with the Oompa-Loompas? | Several years ago my daughters came back from hiking and announced that they’d found the entrance to an undiscovered cave, perhaps even a whole system of caverns. I was skeptical. After all, they were hiking a maintained trail in a national forest, just 10 minutes from our house. There were even picnic shelters close by. | Before Los Angeles was a tangle of vehicle-choked freeways, it supported one of the largest electric railway systems in the world. | On Feb. 10 last year, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. showed his eight colleagues how he intended to uproot the constitutional right to abortion. | After the actor Charlie Carver bought a 755-square-foot house, he hired a designer who shared his eccentric vision. | Gutsy and offbeat, with an abundance of heart. The stars who rose to the top in 2023 shared a similar mentality: do it their own way and go full tilt without sacrificing emotion or authenticity. Here are eight artists who shook up their scenes and resonated with fans. | With Ukraine’s military facing mounting deaths and a stalemate on the battlefield, army recruiters have become increasingly aggressive in their efforts to replenish the ranks, in some cases pulling men off the streets and whisking them to recruiting centers using intimidation and even physical force. | In 2016, Jackie Bogart was living in upstate New York with three children to care for but felt she was barely able to leave the house. She had just escaped an abusive relationship and had long dealt with depression and anxiety. “I just was having a hard time, day to day, just living,” she said. | A rhapsodic urgency can be felt in “Sing a Black Girl’s Song,” one reflective of Black women’s dreams of freedom and their concomitant demands for those dreams to become a reality. | The Israeli military said on Friday that it had retrieved the bodies of two 19-year-old soldiers and a 28-year-old event planner who were kidnapped during the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 and held captive in Gaza. | Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Hi busy bees! Welcome to today’s Spelling Bee forum.

Water, electricity, phone lines, the sewage system — everything.” | The campaign posters were bright and stylish, with slogans like “New York Needs New Voices.” In 2018, they were all over the East Village, where Emily Heinz Bina was living. The graphic design caught her eye, but the candidate captured her interest. | An article on Wednesday about the rehabilitation of Kibbutz Kfar Aza misattributed the quotation, “We don’t know if he is OK, if he sees daylight.” The comment was made by Alon Shamriz’s brother Ido, not by Alon. | The maker of the blockbuster video game The Last of Us, which was adapted into the hit HBO series by the same name earlier this year, announced that it would cancel development of its long-anticipated online multiplayer version of the game. | See how well you know the defining personalities of 2023 with The New York Times Faces Quiz. | ACROSTIC — Today’s passage sounds so modern to me that I was surprised to learn that its source dates all the way back to 2005, which is almost before Amazon Prime existed — if you were just about to say, “Hey, Caitlin, 2005 wasn’t really so long ago.” The constructors David Balton and Jane Stewart drew from “Talk to the Hand,” a book by Lynne Truss, a prodigious writer, journalist and noted stickler of language. (You may remember her earlier book “Eats, Shoots and Leaves,” which was a major best seller that I really enjoyed, not that I remember exactly where to put my commas, all the time, sadly.) | Jump to: Tricky Clues | At The New York Times, we call it “counterprogramming”: stories that may provide a breath of fresh air for readers exhausted by tales of hardship, peril and acrimony. | “The Family Plan” has a familiar premise: A seemingly ordinary family man with a clandestine identity is hiding a violent past. It’s been done as farce, in “True Lies,” and as drama, in “A History of Violence,” in both instances to rousing effect. “Family Plan,” starring Mark Wahlberg as the dissembling patriarch, plays it for laughs, using his deception and its unraveling as a springboard for screwball comedy. | A former New York City police officer was indicted in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday on charges of coercing a boy to engage in sex and soliciting explicit sexual conversations and nude photographs from boys. | Senate Democrats announced on Thursday that they would put off their upcoming holiday break and stay in Washington next week to press for passage of a bill pairing military assistance for Ukraine with a crackdown on migration at the U.S. border with Mexico, as lawmakers on both sides of the talks reported progress toward a compromise. | As Israeli troops pulled out after a two-and-a-half-day incursion into the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said on Thursday that the raid had killed at least 12 people and wounded 34 others. | Republicans in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives voted this week to withhold millions of dollars from the University of Pennsylvania’s veterinary school amid an uproar over the school’s response to antisemitism on campus. | These are troubling times for American higher education. On one side, some students at a handful of elite universities have made harsh anti-Israel statements, some crossing the line into outright antisemitism, and some university presidents have been diffident and mealy-mouthed in their responses. Ugly as these events have been, however, there isn’t much reason to believe that the quality of education at these institutions — which, in any case, account for a small fraction of America’s college enrollment — is under serious threat.",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York

Eisenhower once praised Walt Disney for his “genius as a creator of folklore.” When Disney died in 1966, the line made it into his obituary, evidence of its accuracy.

The company Disney created appointed itself keeper of these traditions for Americans, spinning up fresh tales and (more often) deftly repackaging old ones to appeal to a new century. | Each year, as the staff of the Book Review chooses the year’s 100 notable books and 10 best books, we know we have to make some tough decisions. Invariably, some wonderful books don’t make the cut. | Q: My wife and I have rented a market-rate two-bedroom apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, since 2013. During that time, we’ve requested once to have some rooms painted. But other kinds of wear and tear have developed over the years: The hardwood floor is losing its seal, some kitchen cabinet doors are chipping, and the wood under the bathroom sink is peeling. Our refrigerator is in working order, but it’s unattractive. Is there a law that states that after 10 years the tenant is entitled to some minor renovations? We would like the landlord to complete them. | Disney’s animated achievements — certain ones — are imprinted on our brains, in part because the company reminds us about them seemingly nonstop. Fresh from the Disney vault! Restored to its original glory! | The Northshore Mall, in Peabody, Mass., was the mall. Our mall. The competing mall, Liberty Tree, a mile or so down the road, suffered from inferior stores and worse parking. So in the 1990s and early 2000s, Northshore was where the kids from my area congregated, to wander through the department stores, and then on toward J. Crew, for roll-neck sweaters; Abercrombie & Fitch, for boyfriend jeans; and Pacific Sunwear, for anything related to skater culture. | Temperatures across China are forecast to plunge this weekend, as parts of the country reel from widespread disruptions caused by wintry conditions and heavy rains, including a subway collision in Beijing that left hundreds of commuters hospitalized. | Israeli security officials scored a major intelligence coup in 2018: secret documents that laid out, in intricate detail, what amounted to a private equity fund that Hamas used to finance its operations. | The deaths of three hostages whom Israel said its troops had mistakenly shot and killed in Gaza were reverberating in Israel early Saturday as political leaders mourned them and protesters urged their government to prioritize the remaining hostages’ safe return over the country’s war goals. | On most days, Mike Greenberg loves a good argument.

And if you are the kind of woman who leans into Jane Austen, finely woven cardigans, farmers’ market flowers, impeccable grammar, the ’90s, book-filled prewar apartments and the primacy of small, independent businesses, then your relationship to the film may be ritualistic — even devotional. | Good morning, dear connectors. Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Hi busy bees! Welcome to today’s Spelling Bee forum.

There’s a bonus column, which apparently enables the extravagant stairstep of eight eight-letter entries through the middle of the puzzle (according to its constructor notes, below). I also noted the scarcity of “glue” here — less nondescript fill makes a puzzle more interesting but often a lot tougher, especially if you’re not quite on the right wavelength. This is one of those puzzles that tests how open your mind is rather than what arcane facts are in it, so don’t feel frustrated if you’re misdirected a few times (I certainly was!). You’ll get into the swing of things. | In November 1974, a small group of American college presidents spent three weeks traveling through China, visiting universities, communes, factories and even the office of Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, who was still four years away from taking over as Communist Party leader. | It’s easy to take the grocery store for granted. After all, there’s nothing particularly remarkable about the mundane task of picking up our weekly bread, fruit and cereal. Yet each store requires dozens and often hundreds of people to run — to fill the shelves, take inventory, organize displays of canned beans or help a customer locate the vanilla extract. In the latest episode of On the Job, we spent the day with Amy O’Rourke at Stew Leonard’s — a grocery chain in the Northeast that goes out of its way to engage and entertain shoppers. Her goal as assistant seafood manager is not only to ensure that customers can find the freshest clams, shrimp and salmon, but also to make a job that can feel invisible, visible. She accomplishes that with an abundance of energy, an uncannily outgoing personality and occasionally, a lobster suit. | Can you sort 8 historical events? | Days after President Biden said Israel was losing support for its military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the president’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on Friday played down differences between the two allies after meetings with

His parents lived 100 miles away. It seemed like a good move: closer to family, but not too close. Then my in-laws bought a second home three minutes from ours. It’s awkward! They will have appointments scheduled months in advance, but wait to ask to drop by to see our kids until the day of the proposed visit. My spouse works long hours, so I am the host — and I’m busy. They ask to come over frequently, but if we suggest a different plan, like taking them to dinner, they dig in their heels until we relent. Obviously, there is a lack of communication. They are also the main reason my husband and I fight.

When none of the presidents — representing Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania — could muster a straightforward reply to the question from Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, about whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” amounted to “bullying or harassment,” many prominent Democrats joined Republicans in denouncing the testimony. | A few years after the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests started a Christmas tree farm, Nigel Manley, who oversaw the operations, began noticing some interesting developments among the rows of fragrant balsam and Fraser firs lining the land. | On any given night, far from bright city lights, there’s a chance that you’ll see a beautiful streak shoot across the sky as a meteor flies overhead.

They were piling shortbread cookies onto a plate and filling a glass with milk to welcome and fuel Santa. Crackers lay waiting for the next day, ready to be pulled apart with a bang.

The show, titled “SCORE,” is an excellent mash of what may be described as multiple mini-exhibitions, with new works demonstrating the breadth of this New York-based artist’s skill and vision across various mediums: sculpture, painting and performance art. | In 2015, Norma Pérez adopted a vegan diet to combat her arthritis. But she worried that she’d miss out on the Salvadoran dishes she grew up with, particularly holiday dishes like her tamales and pan con pollo. | And now, the end is near | London’s Metropolitan Police arrested a 39-year-old deputy U.S. Marshal on Wednesday morning at Heathrow Airport for acting inappropriately while intoxicated on a flight from New York, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.  | A severe weather system that rampaged through the South on Saturday spawned powerful tornadoes in Tennessee, leaving six people dead and more than 20 injured, buildings in tatters and trees and power lines toppled, officials said. | Hip-hop got its start in a Bronx apartment building 50 years ago. The concept of home has been at the center of the genre ever since. | Last October, when it was announced that Sarah Burton was leaving Alexander McQueen, the house she had nurtured to new gorgeousness after the suicide of its founder, and would be replaced by an Irish designer named Seán McGirr, it set off a sort of tsunami of angst in the fashion world. | This personal reflection is part of a series called Turning Points, in which writers explore what critical moments from this year might mean for the year ahead. You can read more by visiting the Turning Points series page. | An Oct. 13 strike that killed a videographer for the Reuters news agency and injured six others in southern Lebanon was carried out by the Israeli military and appeared to be a deliberate attack, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday. | The box office blockbuster “Oppenheimer” will be released in Japan in 2024, a local distributor announced on Thursday, quashing speculation over the film’s rollout there following criticism of its promotion online. | Santa Catalina Island is one of the most remote pieces of Los Angeles County, part of a 20-million-year-old archipelago in the Pacific Ocean known as the Channel Islands. | Simon & Schuster announced on Thursday a board of directors with experience that covers the life cycle of a book, including traditional publishing and audiobooks, movie spinoffs and TikTok. | I wash my face in the morning with Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel, then moisturize with the Blue Cocoon from May Lindstrom — it’s been my go-to skin-care product for about four years. I finish with the Rodan + Fields Essentials Sunscreen. Day to day, I typically don’t wear makeup. If anything, I’ll use Armani Beauty Luminous Silk Concealer as needed and a gloss or balm rather than a lipstick — I’ve been using Vaseline forever. But if I’m ever taking it up a notch for an event, typically someone else is applying the makeup and I gravitate toward a red lip rather than a dramatic eye. Armani makes a nice true red that I’ve been using. I’m more consistent with Armani’s Sì Eau de Parfum — it’s part of my routine. | A three-bedroom, two-bath, 1,550-square-foot apartment with a windowed eat-in kitchen, a large living room, a dining room or den, an en suite secondary bedroom, a wood-burning fireplace, a washer/dryer, window air-conditioning and a basement storage locker, in a 13-story prewar doorman building with a live-in super, a courtyard and shared laundry. Geoffrey Gottlieb and Sandra Busch, 212-590-2473, Christie’s International Real Estate; christiesrealestate.com | A five-bedroom, three-full-and-two-half-bath, 4,944-square-foot house built in 1991 around an internal courtyard, with hardwood floors; a living room with a stone fireplace; a family room with wood beams; an eat-in kitchen with an island, pantry, dining area with built-ins and deck access; a bright en suite primary bedroom with high ceilings, a Juliet balcony and a walk-in closet; an office; spacious secondary bedrooms; a mudroom; an attached four-car garage; a courtyard with a Koi pond and garden; an in-ground pool and a gazebo, on two acres. Ryan Cornell, 203-200-0203, William Pitt Julia B Fee Sotheby’s International Realty; williampitt.com | Lawmakers in Russia on Thursday set March 17 as the date for the country’s next presidential election, launching a race that few doubt will result in President Vladimir V. Putin’s re-election for another six-year term. | About 700 Washington Post employees walked off the job for 24 hours on Thursday, protesting stalled union contract negotiations and expected layoffs. | On Thursday, Pantone announced its 2024 color of the year: Peach Fuzz. It’s a hue that the company described in a news release as variously “gentle,” “velvety,” “contemporary” and “nurturing.” In other words, a pretty hardworking hue. | As the Kremlin reveled in the failure of Congress to approve new military assistance for Ukraine and President Biden railed against Republican lawmakers for “kneecapping” an ally in their hour of need, Ukrainian soldiers, political leaders and Kyiv’s allies were all left asking the same question on Thursday: What happens if the United States stops providing military assistance? | Bonds have been on an impressive monthlong rally fueled by investors’ hopes that the Fed will begin cutting interest rates next year. That bet may be tested as soon as Friday with the release of new payroll data that Wall Street expects will show the labor market cooling further. | Heavy rain and floods in East Africa that started in October have killed at least 300 people and displaced millions more. Locations in Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, including the giant Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya, have suffered the most, but the extreme rains have affected the whole region and are ongoing. | Nicky (Luke Evans), a grizzled book publisher, is visiting his family with his 8-year-old son, Owen (Christopher Woodley) — and Gabriel (Billy Porter), Nicky’s husband of 13 years, is conspicuously absent. At the dinner table, Nicky awkwardly breaks the news: He and Gabriel are divorcing. “It must be hard fighting for the right to marry and then ending up in a divorce court like everyone else,” says Nicky’s teenage nephew. | In 2018, Dewayne Johnson won a lawsuit against Monsanto; he had argued that the company’s glyphosate-based weedkiller, which he had used as a school district groundskeeper in Northern California, caused him to develop non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Jurors found that Monsanto had failed to warn consumers of the potential risks. | The musical “Waitress” is about liberation, empowerment and pie — three things that are easy to wholeheartedly endorse, and turned it into a Broadway hit. Brett Sullivan’s live capture confirms the show’s biggest asset, nearly 10 years after its premiere: Sara Bareilles’s enduring wonder of a score, which skillfully melds a pop melodicism rooted in the 1970s with the narrative demands of musical theater. Bareilles’s first Broadway effort displays a joyful confidence and an unerring sense of emotional release. Unfortunately, the glare of the cameras also highlights flaws that were easier to overlook onstage, mostly having to do with the way power imbalances are depicted. | Partway through the documentary “Total Trust,” the Chinese journalist Sophia Xueqin Huang diagnoses the readiness of Chinese civilians to comply with expanding surveillance measures. “It’s just like the story of the boiling frog,” she says; the ceding of small privacies gives way to the surrender of larger freedoms until — before you know it — every facet of life is monitored and controlled. | Murder, mayhem and moral collapse follow all too quickly when an apocalyptic earthquake flattens Seoul in “Concrete Utopia,” South Korea’s entry in this year’s Oscar contest for best international feature. Smoothly shaping familiar genre tropes into a brutal study of class warfare and the stifling of pity, the director, Um Tae-hwa (who wrote the script with Lee Shin-ji), makes human kindness the first casualty of social disorder. | A woman in Ohio who threw a burrito bowl at a Chipotle worker and was convicted of assault has been sentenced to an unusual punishment that includes working in fast food for two months. | When Abdullah Abu Nada, a chemist who was at work in Gaza City, heard that the building where his family was staying had been hit by an airstrike, he texted his wife, Samah. She didn’t reply, and Abu Nada then called his 15-year-old son, Ahmed. When his son didn’t answer, Abu Nada called his 16-year-old daughter, Nawal. She didn’t answer, either. All three of them — as well as the two other Abu Nada children: Anas, 12, and Mohammed, 8 — had been killed in the airstrike. | A 14-year-old girl shot and killed a schoolmate and wounded five other children on Thursday before killing herself at a school in the western Russian city of Bryansk, officials said. | Two months ago, on Oct. 7, Hamas and other militant groups based in Gaza launched a cross-border attack in Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a military campaign to eradicate Hamas that has devastated Gaza, with the Gazan health authorities saying that more than 15,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. Israel’s military estimates that it has killed several thousand Hamas fighters. | Opinion columnists and contributors assess the candidates in Alabama. | Over the last few months, Nikki Haley has gained enough in the polls to suggest she is on the verge of surpassing Ron DeSantis as the main threat to Donald J. Trump in the race to become the Republican candidate for 2024. | The New York Times Audio app is home to journalism and storytelling, and provides news, depth and serendipity. If you haven’t already, download it here — available to Times news subscribers on iOS — and sign up for our weekly newsletter. | The first sign that “Finnegans Wake” may be among the most challenging books you have ever encountered is its opening line, which begins midsentence. | Geddy Lee’s memoir, “My Effin’ Life,” has the distinction of being the season’s only memoir by a famous author that is not at its best in audio form. No offense to the Canadian rocker; his 16-hour-and-20-minute narration is heroic. But if you take the aural route, you’ll miss the class pictures, family photos and backstage shots (that ’70s hair!) sprinkled through the pages. Lee even includes his bar mitzvah invitation, captioned with a gentle dig at his mother for using the wrong middle name. | What happens when “a dating app for the curious” — one that welcomes users who are into polyamory, nonmonogamy, voyeurism and kinks of all kinds — is practically unusable for an entire weekend? What happens, in other words, to a threesome deferred? | If the candidates trying to wrest their party’s presidential nomination from Donald Trump began the Republican debates over three months ago in a spirit of hope, they have plunged since then into a panicked state. A desperate one. | A monthslong border blockade by Polish truckers is starting to have an effect on Ukrainian soldiers in frozen trenches defending against unrelenting Russian assaults, making already fierce battles even more difficult. | Since the terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, Israel has recovered a trove of intelligence that its military has used to assess the extent of Hamas’s plans, as well as its battle tactics and abilities, information that Israeli officials say has helped shape the war in Gaza. | When Ja’Nay Ford Hill, 31, and Ryon Hill, 32, of Dallas got married in Colleyville, Texas, in 2022, their 200-person ceremony included four children: two flower girls and two ring bearers. After the ceremony, the children were relocated to the venue’s bridal suite, where they were supervised, fed and entertained for five hours by a babysitter Ms. Hill had found on Care.com. | Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s announcement that he would leave Congress came as little surprise to his closest colleagues, but his decision to do so a year before the end of his term poses challenges for his party. It will shrink Republicans’ already razor-thin majority in the House as they face a number of issues in the coming months that will require near-unanimous party support. | With the proceeds from an apartment sale and a dream of making wine in Napa Valley, a buyer looked for an investment property to make her money grow. | The Republican-led House on Thursday formally rebuked Representative Jamaal Bowman, Democrat of New York, for setting off a false fire alarm in a House office building in September, the latest in a series of partisan reprisals using a once-rare form of congressional punishment. | There was a moment in early 2023 when Donald Trump seemed like a politician in decline. | Craig Fehrman, a contributor to The New York Times Book Review, recently watched his young son, Henry, read “The Wild Robot” by Peter Brown and wrestle with the feelings the book brought up. In this episode, Craig and Henry talk about why those big, uncomfortable feelings are what made the book such a rewarding read. | During orientation at the Columbia School of Social Work at Columbia University, the country’s oldest graduate program for aspiring social workers, students are given a glossary with “100+ common terms you may see or hear used in class, during discussions and at your field placements.” | In Montreal, I run a discussion salon, frequented by searching Jews like me. I started these salons several years ago with a pretty basic goal: to have people come together, meaningfully and sometimes raucously, around a bonfire of ideas and debate. Our last salon happened just before Oct. 7. The next one happens Thursday, the first night of Hanukkah. When I sent out the invite, many people told me they were OK with the date but that, given the war and what’s happening in the Middle East, they were less comfortable marking the celebration. | As a part-time commentator on things economic, I’m often asked a seemingly straightforward question: If the economy is so good, why are Americans so grumpy? | Imagine you’ve fallen ill. There’s fever and pain, and it doesn’t go away. A trip to the doctor’s office lands you in the emergency room. Surgery follows, then several nights in the hospital. Weeks later, after more doctor’s appointments and loads of prescription medicine, you’re all well again, fit as a fiddle. | George Kennan lost his faith in the Russian city of Tomsk. A journalist, he came in the summer of 1885 to report on the country’s exile system, which every year sent thousands of men, women and children to the wilds of Siberia, intending that they should work, be forgotten and die. In Tomsk he found what one local official called “the worst prison in Siberia,” where entire families crowded into cages too tight for them to move, the air was noxious and the hospital was so “saturated with disease” that a physician there was lobbying to have it burned down. Kennan had come to write a defense of the sprawling network of work camps and prisons. Tomsk broke him. | Good morning. It’s Thursday. We’ll look at why Hanukkah feels different this year. We’ll also find out about New York’s first offshore wind farm, which is sending electricity to Long Island from out in the Atlantic Ocean. | In an age when virtual reality headsets are, if not common, at least accessible to gear heads and gamers, watching a 3-D movie feels a little quaint. In its gimmicky heyday, 3-D was a lark. You laughed at yourself for suddenly ducking at, say, a snake that came hissing out of the screen. More recently, filmmakers have turned to 3-D to enhance the moviegoing experience: Martin Scorsese’s “Hugo,” Alfonso Cuarón’s “Gravity.” With films like these, you’re seeing into a world inside the screen, rather than being poked by it. | Ava DuVernay’s “Origin” is as audacious as it is ambitious. At its core, it concerns an intellectual argument about history and hierarchies of power, but it’s also about the fraught process of making this argument. It’s a daunting conceit that DuVernay has shaped into an eventful narrative that is, by turns, specific and far-ranging, diagnostic and aspirational. It is a great big swing about taking a great big swing, and while the film is more persuasive as a drama than the argument it relays, few American movies this year reach so high so boldly. | Did you ever believe in Santa Claus? | The haunting cleverness of Rumaan Alam’s novel “Leave the World Behind” — published in 2020, when every novel about the apocalypse felt uncannily prophetic — comes in what it doesn’t say. For the whole book, you’re expecting to find out what’s caused the catastrophe that is just beginning to reach the main characters, New Yorkers who just happen to be vacationing out in the sticks when things start going wrong. And then, tensions stretched to the breaking point, the book thwarts all expectations, leaving behind a feeling of lingering unease. | The lines in June Jordan’s “These Poems” explain the poet’s modus operandi. Her poems are made “in the dark,” as if by subterranean or subversive means. They are composed of words that glide away from her like skipping stones destined to submerge in some body of water. The act of being inspired by others is akin to collecting pebbles of experience, letting them escape into flowing consciousness and resurfacing them again in one’s writing. “In the dark” also means to operate from a state of ignorance or confusion. The resolution in the last three stanzas gestures at Jordan’s attempt to learn from others. The poet and reader embrace on the page. The becoming Jordan references at the end of the poem seems possible only through mutual reinforcement. | Color has a life all its own. Without art, without people, it is everywhere, one of the natural wonders of the world. Still what people have managed to do with it sometimes seems miraculous, a gift. Especially in art, where its generosity and warmth become even more direct. Many of my fondest art memories this year involved powerful doses of saturated or unusual color, manifest in a variety of materials and techniques. | It’s the December before a presidential election, which means that Iowa is overflowing with candidates and reporters for its quadrennial caucuses. | In the windowless basement of a Manhattan church last month, Bellevue Hospital hosted a fashion show. | In 1937, Corrado Cagli, a little-known Italian artist, showed a painting at the Comet Gallery in New York and instantly became the talk of the town. | Garrett writes: My wife and I live far from our family, so we’re mailing our holiday gifts. She believes in wrapping before sending. I believe buying online and shipping directly is adequate. The gifts themselves are a meaningful gesture. And wrapping makes no difference, as all gifts are still hidden within the shipping box. | Despite a mediocre snow season last year, the Northeast measured more than 13 million skier visits, its strongest showing in eight years. Much of that interest was driven, no doubt, by the increasing use of multi-mountain passes, with skiers and boarders enjoying late-season snowfall as well as recent snow-making and infrastructure investments. | Since peaking at $479,500 during the fourth quarter of 2022, the median sale price of a home in the United States has sagged, landing at $431,000 during the third quarter of 2023. By that point, prices for single-family homes had fallen in 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities over the course of the year, according to a new study by Point2, while condo prices fell in 37 of the 100 cities. In 15 cities, prices were down for both types of homes. It’s not great news for owners, especially those who settled for a condo last year with a plan to move to a house when the market cooled. | What books are on your night stand? | That thing we keep calling “jazz” refuses to stop overrunning its borders, reworking itself, showing up in new forms identifiable only by the most basic strands of their DNA. All of its subcultures churned out inspired work this year; many show up below. | One hundred and fifty years ago on Thursday, the novelist Willa Cather was born in her grandmother’s house in Virginia. Though she drew from her Southern childhood throughout her career, plucking memories like grapes from the vine, it was the swelling prairies of Nebraska — surreal in their expanse, in their commune with the sky, in the almost tidal energy underfoot — that conjured her most enduring works, the bluestem eternal that proved her muse. | My husband is a restless sleeper. He thrashes around, yanks the comforter up to his chin, then flings it off seconds later — at which point he is often covered in sweat. | When Meg Bellamy got the call that would change her life — the one telling her that after months of auditions, it was she, among thousands of hopefuls, who would play Kate Middleton in the final season of “The Crown” — she was already standing in the shadow of Windsor Castle. But she wasn’t looking the part of a royal just yet. | The Austrian capital beckons as a wintry escape with ice skating paths, cozy coffeehouses and a Christmas market in a palace. | The N.H.S. is one of Britain’s proudest achievements, and it’s unraveling. | What do you think this image is saying? How does it relate to or comment on society or current events? Can you relate to it personally? What is your opinion of its message? | As Israel’s military offensive pushes Palestinian civilians into ever smaller slivers of land, the Israeli military said on Thursday that Hamas militants had fired rockets from inside one of the “humanitarian zones” in southern Gaza. | Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now. | Namaste from Riverdale! In “The Archies,” the director Zoya Akhtar transplants the all-American comic book hamlet to India, where the Anglo-Indian teenager Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda) is up to his usual tricks, dating both Betty (Khushi Kapoor) and Veronica (Suhana Khan). | The Sand Land mine near Southhampton, N.Y., resembles the cratered surface of the moon, a treeless, torn-up work site that underscores the demand for a vital, if often overlooked, natural resource. | The end of the year brings a deluge of “best of” lists at The New York Times, and few are quite as eagerly anticipated as the “best movies” roundup. (Bookworms may think otherwise.) | Sarah Lawrence College for years has promoted itself as an experimental and progressive haven, a leafy enclave where students design curriculums and believe in what its president has called “the underlying goodness of others.” | Hi busy bees! Welcome to today’s Spelling Bee forum. There are a number of terms that appear in both this article and other online discussions of the Spelling Bee; a glossary of those terms compiled by Monicat, a Times reader, can be found below. | Good morning, dear connectors. Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This page contains spoilers for today’s puzzle. Solve Wordle first, or scroll at your own risk. | The president of Seychelles declared a state of emergency on Thursday after a blast at an explosives depot injured almost 200 people and rippled through businesses and homes, sending shock and confusion across the archipelago off the coast of East Africa. | Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy went after an ascendant Nikki Haley during the fourth Republican debate. At moments, Chris Christie stepped in to defend her. | Andrea Fay Friedman, an actress who starred in the groundbreaking television series “Life Goes On,” died on Sunday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 53. | In the tiny Gaza Strip, where more than two million people are trapped, death can feel imminent. Israeli airstrikes, which have resumed after a brief truce, can come at any time and to any place, and food and water remain scarce. Already, more than 16,000 people have been killed in the Hamas-run territory, according to the health ministry. | Nikki Haley clashed repeatedly with Ron DeSantis on Wednesday night in the fourth Republican presidential debate, facing her most sustained scrutiny of the race as the two leading candidates for second place tussled in Tuscaloosa, Ala. | In the fourth and final Republican presidential debate of the year, the narrow policy differences among the candidates were overshadowed by feisty personal clashes and insults. | Leaders of the European Union pressed China on the country’s trade imbalance with Europe and its support for Russia during a visit to Beijing on Thursday that highlighted the growing tensions between the two sides. | As dawn broke in central Paris on Wednesday, a throng of 500 people, mostly French, stood with uncharacteristic patience in a snaking line, intent on buying a decidedly un-French confection: an American doughnut. A hot, glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut, to be exact. | On a bright, cold afternoon on O’Connell Street in central Dublin, Memet Uludag, a businessman and activist, was rolling up an antiracism banner. | The United States has embarked on the biggest industrial policy push in generations, dangling tax breaks, grants and other financial incentives to attract new factories making solar panels, semiconductors and electric vehicles. | Weeks after mechanics working for Tesla in Sweden walked off their jobs in late October, members of other unions across the country and elsewhere in Scandinavia have joined the strike in sympathy by refusing to provide services to Tesla to pressure the automaker to sign a collective agreement with its Swedish workers. | The Kremlin has unleashed a new weapon in its information war with the West: the fake celebrity cameo. | WeWork raised more than $11 billion in funding as a private company. Olive AI, a health care start-up, gathered $852 million. Convoy, a freight start-up, raised $900 million. And Veev, a home construction start-up, amassed $647 million. | Toward the end of Wednesday’s debate, the moderators asked the four Republican candidates onstage which former president would be their inspiration if they were elected. The answers were the ones you’d typically expect. | Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey accused Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida of dodging a question on whether Donald J. Trump was “mentally fit” to be president. | Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, said it was not worth her time to respond to Vivek Ramaswamy. | Nikki Haley thanked Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy after they attacked her during the fourth Republican debate. | Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey also denounced other candidates for fighting among themselves while ignoring their strongest opponent, former President Donald J. Trump. | An article on Wednesday about Mexico’s complicated relationship with a genre of music inspired by the drug trade misstated the day of the Peso Pluma concert in Mexico City. It was a Saturday, not Friday. | “Crazy as it may sound, I like guys who score and act like they’ve been there with no fanfare.” | Jump to: Today’s Theme | Tricky Clues | Vivek Ramaswamy’s defense of Donald J. Trump at Wednesday’s debate quickly devolved into a laundry list of far-right conspiracy theories. | Meta said on Wednesday that it planned to turn Messenger, its global chat and voice messaging app, into a fully encrypted service, a move that is set to rekindle a debate about privacy and security in communications. | While Vivek Ramasamy was attacking Nikki Haley, the former governor of New Jersey stepped in and asked him to “shut up.” | For more than 15 minutes, three of the four Republican candidates on the debate stage fended off sharp questions from Megyn Kelly and made a case for their electability. But as they attacked one another’s records, former President Donald J. Trump, the dominant front-runner in the race, was notably absent from the conversation. | Chris Christie had had enough. | The famed television producer Norman Lear died on Tuesday at the age 101, leaving behind a legacy of sitcoms that helped shape American culture. | The perils of momentum. | The Colorado Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on the question of whether former President Donald J.

He put his influence and reputation on the line to make the case that it was in the United States’ interest to help a beleaguered democracy trying to beat a Russian invasion led by Vladimir V. Putin, and expressed confidence that his party would join him. | Consider this: The most dangerous place to be a child in the world today is Gaza.",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New

She was 95.  | The acclaimed tap dancer Caleb Teicher and the world-champion beatboxer Chris Celiz might seem to belong to very different tribes.

Still, I am often invited to be a guest speaker or lecturer in congregations and universities. Lately, when people ask me questions afterward, they want to know my opinion about the war between Israel and Hamas. I am happy to answer them. Members of the clergy aren’t shut off from the world, and I don’t think our words should be either — we can be a force for good. | Rachel Goldberg’s 23-year-old son, Hersh, was abducted by Hamas at a music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7. In this interview with the Opinion editor Sarah Wildman, Ms. Goldberg reflects on the past two months of the crisis, the recent pause in fighting and the brief moments of “delicious, thankful respite” she felt as hostages returned home — even as her son remains captive. And she argues the hostage plight should be treated as a humanitarian crisis, not a political one. | As I watched the presidents of Harvard, M.I.T. and the University of Pennsylvania struggle last week to respond to harsh congressional questioning about the prevalence of antisemitism on their campuses, I had a singular thought: Censorship helped put these presidents in their predicament, and censorship will not help them escape. | When Tran Mai Huy Thong was growing up as a vegetarian in West Germany, his peers couldn’t comprehend his choice to not eat meat. | Iran’s most prominent human rights activist, Narges Mohammadi, was supposed to be handed the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo on Sunday. | Note: We’ll publish our next image on Jan. 7 to discuss with live moderation on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024. | Hi, everyone!

Specifically, what separates the humdrum from the ho-ho-ho, the blasé from the trailblazing, the “just fine” from the “those were the best I’ve ever had.” | Twenty-three years ago, Abwe Songolo made the fateful decision to keep moving. It was August of 2000, and he had spent hours sailing across Lake Tanganyika from his hometown in the Democratic Republic of Congo to the city of Kigoma in Tanzania, where he had to live on the streets. He had escaped the war engulfing Congo, but Tanzania still felt too close to home. “I wanted to go as far as possible from Congo because of what I’d experienced,” he said. “Because I would have flashbacks of it.” | As an incubator of life, Earth has a lot going for it, something we often fail to appreciate fully from within its nurturing bounds. Merely sending probes and rovers to the moon and Mars won’t do. For various reasons — adventure! apocalypse! commerce! — we insist upon taking our corporeal selves off-world too. Multiple private companies have announced plans to put hotels in space soon. NASA is aiming to 3-D-print lunar neighborhoods within a couple of decades. And while it will probably take longer than that to build and populate an outpost on Mars, preparations are being made: This summer, four NASA crew members began a 378-day stay in simulated Martian housing at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Here’s some of what we know about how Earthlings fare beyond the safety of our home world. | It’s been a year of endless einsteins. In March, a troupe of mathematical tilers announced that they had discovered an “aperiodic monotile,” a shape that can tile an infinite flat surface in a pattern that does not repeat — “einstein” is the geometric term of art for this entity. David Smith, a shape hobbyist in England who made the original discovery and investigated it with three collaborators possessing mathematical and computational expertise, nicknamed it “the hat.” (The hat tiling allows for reflections: the hat-shaped tile and its mirror image.) | For years, conservatives have struggled to persuade American voters that the left-wing tilt of higher education is not only wrong but dangerous. Universities and their students, they’ve argued, have been increasingly clenched by suffocating ideologies — political correctness in one decade, overweening “social justice” in another, “woke-ism” most recently — that shouldn’t be dismissed as academic fads or harmless zeal. | The brutal shedding of Jewish blood on Oct. 7, followed by Israel’s relentless military assault on Gaza, has brought a fraught question to the fore in a moment of surging bigotry and domestic political gamesmanship: Is anti-Zionism by definition antisemitism? | In the British comedy “Extras,” Kate Winslet, who appears as a version of herself, is playing a nun in a film about the Holocaust. When commended for using her platform to bring attention to the atrocities, she replies callously, “I’m not doing it for that. I mean, I don’t think we really need another film about the Holocaust, do we?” She explains that she took the role because if you do a movie about the Holocaust, you’re “guaranteed an Oscar.” | The colonial era entered its death throes after World War II. From 1945 through the 1960s, a global order in which European powers took political control of other countries — occupying them with settlers, subjugating the local populations and exploiting the land and its inhabitants for economic gain — unraveled. Dozens of states in Asia and Africa threw off colonial overlords. Colonialism, once equated by the West with civilizing progress, became synonymous with iniquity. | “We didn’t know anything,” Josh Schwartz said. “We didn’t know the rules and we were making it up as we went along. That’s something that you learn from.” | There will be no good news — only shades of bad — for Rudolph W. Giuliani when he appears in court on Monday for a trial to determine how much he will have to pay two Georgia election workers he lied about after the 2020 presidential race. | Like exercise, flossing and college, travel has long been held up as an incontrovertible good — an essential part of the modern human experience. Lately, though, there’s been some pushback from the smart set, if not the jet set. | “It’s all about me, me, me. That’s what you think, but everything you’re saying is coming from people around you,” says the musician. | The sales of most professional sports teams are fairly predictable. | When Holly Waddington, the costume designer for “Poor Things,” Yorgos Lanthimos’s much heralded phantasmagorical film about a young women’s psychological and sexual awakening that opened on Friday, began thinking about what her heroine would wear, she said she was thinking “skinny arms and these kind of straight skirts with the big bustle.” | On a Monday night last month, a few hours after OpenAI held an event for developers in downtown San Francisco, hundreds of artificial intelligence aficionados packed into a three-story nightclub several blocks away to celebrate a looser, less corporate vision of the A.I. future. | One evening this fall, a crowd of writers and publishing professionals mingled in a speakeasy-style lounge in Midtown Manhattan. The party, hosted by a new company called Electric Postcard Entertainment, was the kind of lavish affair that’s become rare for the book business in an era of corporate consolidation and cuts. | Sometimes even an up-to-the-minute comedy show like “Saturday Night Live” can’t quite stay ahead of the news cycle. Hours after it was announced that Elizabeth Magill, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, was resigning after an appearance before Congress in which she appeared to evade questions about whether students should be punished for calling for the genocide of Jews, “S.N.L.” led its broadcast with a satirical recreation of the Tuesday hearing. | State lawmakers will unveil legislation on Tuesday that would eliminate enormous property tax breaks for Columbia University and New York University, which have expanded to become among New York City’s top 10 largest private property owners. | When Flint, Mich., announced in September that 68 assault weapons collected in a gun buyback would be incinerated, the city cited its policy of never reselling firearms. | Dusk was falling on a chilly fall day on Randall’s Island and a small crowd of people from around the world were milling around New York City’s newest pop-up market. Latin music played as the day’s last shoppers bought their dinners and vendors began packing up their tables. | Just weeks before Hamas launched the deadly Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the head of Mossad arrived in Doha, Qatar, for a meeting with Qatari officials. | I got a message in 2020 from a photographer and climber in Argentina named Pablo Betancourt. He had read something I had written years earlier and had discovered something that he thought might make for a good story. | In most places, it is a trade of little glamour. Transporting bodies, performing autopsies — the role of a coroner’s office tends to be dismissed as a macabre necessity. | Good morning, dear connectors.

In this themeless puzzle, she took a bold grid pattern with lots of white squares and in each corner positioned a marquee answer — ‘something new or that had an appealing sound or cluing potential.’ Then she built out from there.” | Authorities have identified and arrested a suspect in connection with the killings of three homeless men in Los Angeles this week and tied the suspect to a fourth homicide nearby, officials said on Saturday afternoon. | Tim Dorsey, who drew on his years as a crime reporter to fuel a second career writing a long series of darkly comic thrillers set along the back roads and back alleys of Florida’s weird, wild underbelly, died on Sunday at his home in Islamorada, a town in the Florida Keys. He was 62. | Eighty percent of Gazans are displaced from their homes as Israel orders more evacuations. See where thousands have been sheltering amid the war’s destruction. | Vice President Kamala Harris said on Saturday that the United States fiercely opposes forcibly relocating Gaza residents outside the enclave as Israel resumes its bombardment of Hamas terrorists, or in the days and weeks after the war eventually ends. | Israel’s military leadership faced heightened public scrutiny this week after a string of damaging revelations in the Israeli media and The New York Times suggested that senior officers had ignored or dismissed intelligence reports about the likelihood of a major Hamas attack. | As chief executive of Wells Fargo, Timothy J. Sloan failed to clean up a string of scandals that shook the bank and abruptly stepped down amid widespread criticism more than four years ago. | Henry A. Kissinger, the powerful diplomat who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize and accused of being a war criminal for his realpolitik approach to foreign affairs, had a kind of second career on the society circuit, especially in the years after he served as secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. | Mica Ertegun, the New York doyenne of interior design who fled from Communism in postwar Romania, ran a chicken farm in Canada, married a legend of American pop music, and for 50 years dazzled her patrons with stylish décor, died on Saturday at her home in Southampton, N.Y. She was 97. | A former Chilean Army officer has been deported from Florida to Chile to face charges in the kidnapping and killing of a popular folk singer and a prison director days after the 1973 military coup that deposed President Salvador Allende. | Perhaps no federal officeholder in modern American history has been accused of ignoring, testing or breaking as many aspects of campaign finance law so flagrantly, in such a short span of time, as George Santos has. | A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the eastern parts of the Philippines on Saturday, leading to tsunami warnings across the region and as far as the southern part of Japan, nearly 2,000 miles away that were later lifted, the authorities said. | The counter is stacked with blocks of softening butter, there’s three different kinds of sugar in the pantry and every kitchen surface is covered in a dusting of flour.

She met her husband in Albany and eventually settled into life there. | Pope Francis, who reluctantly canceled his trip to the annual United Nations climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, because of a lung infection, sought on Saturday to lend his voice to the world’s destitute facing the brunt of climate disruption. | The annual United Nations climate change conference is underway in Dubai, and swirling around the COP28 negotiations is a complex, acrimonious, international fight over money: | Dear readers, | “I really want to be friends with a whale,” Mikey Day, the “Saturday Night Live” cast member, said this week as he stood inside the American Museum of Natural History and discussed his favorite displays. “They just look so magical.” | When you realize that help is not on the way, what do you do next? | My favorite “Twilight Zone” episode is the one where aliens land and, in a sign of their peaceful intentions, give world leaders a book. Government cryptographers work to translate the alien language. They decipher the title — “To Serve Man” — and that’s reassuring, so interplanetary shuttles are set up. | Henry Kissinger was the wisest of American foreign policy leaders and the most oblivious, the most farsighted and the most myopic, the one with the greatest legacy — and the one we should most study to learn what not to do. | You can tell a lot about a person by what he or she regrets. This holds especially for Supreme Court justices, whose decisions can, with a single vote, upend individual lives and alter the course of history. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. said he probably made a mistake in upholding a law criminalizing gay sex; Justice Harry Blackmun was sorry he ever voted to impose the death penalty. | For some time now, South Korea has been a striking case study in the depopulation problem that hangs over the developed world. Almost all rich countries have seen their birthrates settle below replacement level, but usually that means somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 children per woman.

Supposing, however, that neither of these things is true — the teacher is passionately invested in teaching, and she has many suitable students — yet her students all fail the final exam, eventually we would be forced to say that she might not know math so well. | Remember Snowball, the sulphur-crested cockatoo whose fancy footwork to the Backstreet Boys’ “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” brought him viral fame in 2007? I recently rewatched the video, and it holds up. Here is this bird, perched on the back of a chair. As the song opens, he appears to be sketching out his moves, getting a feel for the song. When the chorus arrives, he shrieks and grooves, he high-kicks and head-bangs, settling into his rhythm, possessed by the beat. | By Canadian standards, the 10.4 billion Canadian dollar military purchase announced this week moved at light speed, possibly within as little as nine months. | Though it was nearly five decades ago, Gay Blackstone can still vividly recall the first time she was sawed in half onstage. Her screams were an intended element of the illusion, but nerves and fear made them genuine that time. | Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has weathered many controversies, including accusations of corruption and allegations this year that a contentious overhaul of the country’s judiciary was a poorly disguised power grab. | When Laney Serface was a young girl growing up in Northern California, she pinned a news article about Sandra Day O’Connor among the ephemera of theater tickets and photographs on her bulletin board. | “I’m excited for people to see the show,” Beyoncé says early in “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” based on her recent world tour and seventh studio album. “But I’m really excited for everyone to see the process.” | Last year Charlene Truong Launer, a social media content creator, bought a real Christmas tree from a seller on a sidewalk in Manhattan. | After four seasons on the NBC crime caper “Good Girls,” Christina Hendricks was done with digging through trash bins and having guns held to her head. | There have been a combined 37 named storms this year in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins. A high proportion of those quickly escalated. | Most older Americans want to live at home as long as they can, but finding and affording the help they need often isn’t easy. There are severe shortages of home health aides in many parts of the country. Hiring them is costly. And most middle-class people will have to pay for home care themselves if they will need it for the long haul. Here’s a guide to locating home care for an older person. | At an emotional evening news conference immediately after he was removed as speaker of the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy gave an inconclusive answer about whether he would remain in Congress. | In the months before Christopher Paolini wrote the book that made him a star in young adult fantasy, he built a hobbit hole. He’d been home-schooled, and by the time he turned 15 he’d already graduated from high school and read many of the classics — Leo Tolstoy, Alexandre Dumas and Jane Austen among them. So, in his family’s backyard near the banks of the Yellowstone River in Paradise Valley, Mont., he dug a 10-foot hole and converted a massive satellite dish into a makeshift roof. Elaborate plans for a Viking-style mead hall danced through his head. | Santa Catalina Island is the crown jewel of the Channel Islands, an archipelago off the coast of Southern California that is so biodiverse it is often called “North America’s Galápagos.” | Q: In my townhome community on Long Island, the board is mandating that we submit to inspections of the exteriors and windows of our homes by an outside company. If the inspectors find deficiencies, we will be given time to correct them, or face escalating fines if we do not. Based on our experience, we expect that deficiencies will be highly discretionary. Residents own their homes and the small plots of land on which they sit, meaning we must grant the inspectors permission to enter our properties. Our governing documents already provide a mechanism to deal with obvious signs of neglect in isolated cases, but not these mass forced inspections. We keep our homes in generally excellent shape. Must we comply, and is this even legal in New York? | What would Jesus do? It’s a question that the political journalist Tim Alberta takes seriously in his brave and absorbing new book, “The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory,” pressing the evangelicals he meets to answer a version of it — even if a number of them clearly do not want to. | Under the light drizzle of a Tuesday morning last month, Ríonach Ní Néill and a group of friends set up a small platform in front of the United States Embassy in Dublin. | Few government agencies touch the lives of more Americans than the Social Security Administration — the agency pays $1.4 trillion in benefits to more than 71 million people every year. | Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the Kansas City Chiefs, the N.F.L.’s defending champions, is a very loud place. Players say that when the noise reaches top volume, they can feel vibrations in their bones. During a 2014 game, a sound meter captured a decibel reading equivalent to a jet’s taking off, earning a Guinness World Record for “Loudest crowd roar at a sports stadium.” Chiefs fans know how to weaponize noise, quieting to a churchlike hush when the team’s great quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, calls signals but then, when opponents have the ball, unleashing a howl that can even drown out the sound of the play call crackling through the speaker inside the rival quarterback’s helmet. | At a recent rehearsal of the Scottish Ballet, Marge Hendrick did something unusual for a ballerina. Running through a scene from “Cinders!,” a gender-bending new version of “Cinderella,” she grazed her partner Evan Loudon’s chin reassuringly as he looked down, unsure of himself. Then, Hendrick extended a hand to Loudon and paraded him around her, welcoming him to her world. | Bands of Ukrainian soldiers fighting to take back territory on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, an area long controlled by Russia, have been bombed by Russian warplanes, assaulted by Russian infantry and stalked by drones. | The return of beloved characters along with ambitious new titles turned this year into one of the video game industry’s best, leaving players with an embarrassment of riches. | “I hope you don’t mind if we carry on,” Juicy says at the end of “Fat Ham.” The other characters in the play then begin cleaning and clearing the stage, an act that affirms Juicy’s proposition and, in this work inspired by Shakespeare’s most famous tragedy, suggests that there might be a way for them to work through their shared trauma together. | This year’s best thrillers come in various shades of suspense, dread and wonder. But each leads the reader down a twisty path toward an unknown destination. | One air traffic controller went into work drunk this summer and joked about “making big money buzzed.” Another routinely smoked marijuana during breaks. A third employee threatened violence and then “aggressively pushed” a colleague who was directing airplanes. | It’s a good day when Frank Lee, a retired chef, can slip out to the hardware store, fairly confident that his wife, Robin, is in the hands of reliable help. He spends nearly every hour of every day anxiously overseeing her care at their home on the Isle of Palms, a barrier island near Charleston, S.C. | The newcomer landed in a district of northern Toronto and announced his bid for Canada’s Parliament. Though few knew him, an important factor helped offset his lack of name recognition — the backing of prominent local Chinese-Canadians. | One day this summer, the internet personality Adin Ross switched on his camera and started broadcasting himself live to thousands of fans, sipping a Yerba Mate drink and nodding along to Lil Uzi. | What doesn’t kill you might make you stronger. When it comes to nature’s toxins, they might even save your life (or at least blunt the sting of its finality). The distinction, as the evolutionary biologist Noah Whiteman explores in “Most Delicious Poison,” is all in the dosage. | In the first sentence of Kate Christensen’s unflinching eighth novel, “Welcome Home, Stranger,” the reader learns that Rachel Calloway’s mother has died — and she does what most people do when a parent passes away: “You get on a plane and go home.” | Deep inside the CBS Broadcast Center in Midtown Manhattan, I stood in a corridor observing a melee. | The United States and 21 other countries pledged on Saturday at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050, saying the revival of nuclear power was critical for cutting carbon emissions to near zero in the coming decades. | The expulsion of George Santos from the House on Friday, after a year shaped by audacious lies and outright frauds, ended his 11-month congressional tenure. But as he stormed off Capitol Hill, Mr. Santos made abundantly clear that he had no intention of returning to obscurity. | It was a mild Sunday evening in Surrey, a city near Vancouver, British Columbia, and Hardeep Singh Nijjar was ready to drive home after spending the day at his Sikh temple. He had told a friend that he thought he was being followed, but that night, he was just eager to celebrate Father’s Day with his family. | The Biden administration’s crackdown on methane leaks from oil wells is based in part on a new powerful policy tool that could strengthen its legal authority to cut greenhouse gas emissions across the entire economy — including from cars, power plants, factories and oil refineries. | Vice President Kamala Harris pledged at a United Nations climate summit on Saturday that the United States would spend billions more to help developing nations fight and adapt to climate change, telling world leaders that “we must do more” to limit global temperature rise. | New York is on the verge of becoming the first U.S. city to charge drivers for entering its busiest areas, but it is following three cities overseas where such tolling systems have become a way of life. | Crowded together with 90 other migrants on a rickety fishing vessel bound for Spain, Moustapha Diouf watched 10 of them die, one by one, from heat and exhaustion. | Ian Devaney and Aidan Noell, the married couple behind the indie pop trio Nation of Language, have been on a roll since they asked friends and family to fund their debut record in 2018 in lieu of wedding gifts. | On the same soundstage where Bob Barker lorded over “The Price Is Right,” “Squid Game” is coming to life. | NOTE: The previous bug that omitted the HA word from today’s Spelling Bee has been resolved. Today’s Spelling Bee can be solved with 249 points and an HA word.  | Good morning, dear connectors. Welcome to today’s Connections forum, where you can give and receive puzzle — and emotional — support. | Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This page contains spoilers for today’s puzzle. Solve Wordle first, or scroll at your own risk. | Gazans were bracing for expanded hostilities on Saturday, a day after the truce between Israel and Hamas ended, as Israel began turning its focus on southern Gaza for the war’s next phase and as the flow of vital supplies of food, water and medicine again slowed to a trickle. | An article on Friday about how complicated it can be for American presidents to balance their relationships with foreign allies misstated the title of Narendra Modi, the leader of India. He is the prime minister, not the president. | “To hell with this place.” | The Academy Award-winning actress Susan Sarandon apologized Friday for saying at a pro-Palestinian rally last month that people feeling afraid of being Jewish right now were “getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.” | Growing up, all Yuni Matsumoto wanted was to fit in. | SATURDAY PUZZLE — This is the third Times crossword from Royce Ferguson — after a three-year hiatus — and his second Saturday grid. It’s stylish! There’s great cluing, a lot of snappy new entries and the puzzle’s arrangement uses long entries as links to connect its quadrants, which makes getting stranded a distinct probability. I got stuck a few times, but I can’t point to anything obscure or unfair, just the kind of subterfuge that makes for a good, chewy themeless challenge. | As the truce in the Israel-Hamas war was ending on Thursday, Cindy McCain, the executive director of the United Nations’ World Food Program, met virtually with her staff to address an internal uproar over accusations that she was not leveraging her position to speak out against the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. | The holiday season has arrived in New York City, ushering in a host of performances and events, from modern retellings of “The Nutcracker” to holiday-themed jazz shows at Lincoln Center and outdoor train displays at the New York Botanical Garden. Here’s a list of shows and events to attend. | Sandra Day O’Connor gave up lifetime tenure on the Supreme Court — a job she loved and one with extraordinary power — to care for her husband of 52 years as he deteriorated from dementia. | The actress Julianna Margulies, who drew criticism this week after saying on a podcast that some Black people not standing with Jews after the recent attack by Hamas had been “brainwashed to hate Jews,” said on Friday that she “did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.” | A federal judge on Friday rejected claims by former President Donald J. Trump that he enjoyed absolute immunity from criminal charges accusing him of seeking to reverse the 2020 election, slapping down his argument that the indictment should be tossed out because it was based on actions he took while he was in office. | A suburban county in Georgia agreed on Friday to use a new voter information database endorsed by the election denial movement, a move that defied warnings from voting rights groups, election security experts and state election officials. | A protester self-immolated on Friday afternoon outside of the Israeli Consulate building in Atlanta, in what the police described as “likely an extreme act of political protest.” | Follow live updates on the fourth Republican presidential debate. | Henri Lopes, a writer and former prime minister of the Republic of Congo whose pioneering fiction mocked the abuses of African leaders but who later served one of the continent’s most brutal, died on Nov. 2 in Suresnes, a suburb of Paris. He was 86. | Of all the absurdities in “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” the one that takes the cake comes in the homestretch, long after the film’s revealed itself to be both a face-warping concert movie and a moving, unexpectedly transparent feat of self-portraiture, after the screen’s gone black and the speakers silent during her performance of “Alien Superstar” (which happened for about 10 minutes on the tour’s Phoenix stop) and the placid voices at “Renaissance” mission control sound concerned, after we’ve beheld one costuming outrage chase another, after we’ve witnessed technicians inform her that something’s impossible and she informs them that she’s looked the problem up and that, indeed, it is possible. (“Eventually, they realize this bitch will not give up,” she says, backstage, to the camera.) | Before we wallow in the downfall of George Santos, allow me a toast of appreciation to the freshly defrocked lawmaker and his fellow lawmakers. It takes a lot to get booted from the House by one’s colleagues, but the New York Republican really applied himself. And while his 11 very weird months in office were a stain on American democracy, here’s hoping his departure serves to reassure a politically disillusioned nation that there is a level of deception, corruption and lunacy too extra even for Congress. It is a nice reminder that, on special occasions, most lawmakers still know how to do the right thing.",The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York Times | The New York

The conversations have been edited and condensed. | Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday promised a floor vote to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry against President Biden, hoping to provide legal heft to an investigation that has been underway for months but has so far failed to prove Republicans’ claims that Mr. Biden accepted bribes. | When art dealers decide to participate in fairs like Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the many tricky decisions they will make is this one: Whether the pieces they choose to feature fall into the primary market category — meaning that they have never been owned by anyone but the artist — or the secondary market, for works that have been bought and sold before. | Each December, visitors from around the world descend upon South Florida for the annual Miami Art Week. Over the past few years, the region has also had an influx of new residents.

In 1986, across the avenue at Lafayette in the Drake Hotel, was where New York first noticed him; Bryan Miller awarded Lafayette four stars in The New York Times two years later. Scores of restaurants and decades later, at Four Twenty Five, Mr. Vongerichten is relying on a seasoned veteran, Jonathan Benno, who was the chef de cuisine at Thomas Keller’s Per Se and the executive chef at Lincoln Ristorante before having his own place in NoMad. The menu in the new restaurant is à la carte and seasonal. January, not July, comes to mind with Nantucket bay scallop tartare; tricolor cauliflower; chicory salad with walnuts and pears; winter squash agnolotti with brown butter vinaigrette; a main dish of celery root done francese-style; pan-roasted steelhead trout with pumpkin seed gremolata and roasted squash; chicken breast cloaked in black truffle crumbs and served with black truffle butter; and charred duck breast with roasted cabbage. There’s also a seven-course tasting. Some dishes, notably the pastas and crudos, announce Mr. Benno, while others, like steamed black sea bass with winter mushrooms, are clearly from Mr. Vongerichten’s portfolio. “Black sea bass is the best fish in America,” he said. The 84-seat restaurant, designed by Norman Foster (like the building that houses it), is on the second floor, softly done in tones of gray and burgundy, with a gleaming kitchen behind a wall of glass, and a soaring ceiling. There’s a bar on the ground floor, with a vibrant Larry Poons painting above it, where small plates like sliders and chicken samosas will be served. Through the end of the year it will be dinner only, with lunch to follow next month, and eventually breakfast.
